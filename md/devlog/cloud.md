What is the Cloud?   
   
Cloud can be loosely defined as "Someone else's computer"   
   
Cloud is a collection of services that create a platform which include:   
   
   
- Media Services   
- Databases   
- Security   
- Virtual Servers   
- Networking   
- Data Storage   
- Machine Learning   
- Analytics   
   
   
- These services come with a specific feature set aimed at making an organization's life easier by hosting these services for them in remotely.   
   
   
- You can choose where in the world you want to run these services, access them remotely and fine tune them to your requirements.   
   
   
- Saving the organization a lot of money had they hosted these services themselves.   
   
   
- [AWS](../devlog/aws.md) has over 200 services.   
   
   
- Pay-as-you-go pricing:   
   
   
  - Billed by the second for using services   
  - 60 second minimum   
  - Use 83 seconds and get charged for only 83 s   
  - [AWS Lambda](../devlog/AWS%20Lambda.md) allows you to pay per millisecond !   
   
   
- Trade "capital expense" for "variable expense"   
  - capital expense is money spent ahead to buy infrastructure   
  - In cloud, we are opting for variable expense instead of capital expense.   
- We don't need to guess capacity.   
- "Go global" in minutes.   
- Avoid undifferentiated heavy lifting.
