Argumentum a fortiori (literally "argument from the stronger [reason]") is a form of argumentation that draws upon existing confidence in a proposition to argue in favor of a second proposition that is held to be implicit in, and even more certain than, the first.   
   
## Usage   
   
In ancient Indian logic (nyaya), the instrument of argumentation known as kaimutika or kaimutya nyaya is found to have resemblance with a fortiori argument. Kaimutika has been derived from the words kim uta meaning "what is to be said of".   
   
## Examples   
   
   
- If it is known that a person is dead on a certain date, it may be inferred a fortiori that he is exempted from the suspect list for a murder that took place on a later date, viz “Allen died on April 22nd, therefore, a fortiori, Allen did not murder Joe on April 23rd.”   
- If a teacher refuses to add 5 points to a student's grade, on the grounds that the student does not deserve an additional 5 points, it can be inferred a fortiori that the teacher will also refuse to raise the student's grade by 10 points.
