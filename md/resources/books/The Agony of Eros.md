## Foreword: The Reinvention of Love   
   
love —in the strong sense that a long historical tradition has granted it— is threatened   
   
Implacably, Han argues that the minimum condition for true love is possessing sufficient courage to accept self-negation for the sake of discovering the Other.At the same time, he provides an intensive survey of all the traps set for, and attacks perpetrated on, the very possibility of eros in a world that, as it stands, cares only for agreement, agreeability, and narcissistic gratification.   
   
## Melancholia   
   
Love, the claim goes, is foundering because of endless freedom of choice, the overabundance of options, and the compulsion for perfection. In a world of unlimited possibilities, love itself represents an impossibility. Passion, too, is said to have grown cold.   
   
Another influence is now underway, which is corroding love far more than endless freedom or unlimited possibilities. The crisis of love does not derive from too many others so much as from the erosion of the Other. This erosion is occurring in all spheres of life; its corollary is the mounting narcissification of the Self. In fact, the vanishing of the Other is a dramatic process — even though, fatefully enough, it largely escapes notice.   
   
Erotic experience presumes the asymmetry and exteriority of the Other. It is not by chance that Socrates the lover is called atopos. The Other, whom I desire and who fascinates me, is placeless. He or she is removed from the language of sameness: “Being atopic, the Other makes language indecisive: one cannot speak of the Other, about the Other; every attribute is false, painful, erroneous, awkward.”   
   
Our contemporary culture of constant comparison (Ver-Gleichen) leaves no room for the negativity of what is atopos. We are constantly comparing one thing to another, thereby flattening them into the Same, precisely because we no longer experience the atopia of the Other. The negativity of the atopic Other refuses consumption. Therefore, the society of the consumer endeavors to eliminate atopic otherness in favor of consumable —heterotopic— differences. In contrast to otherness, difference is positive. Yet today, negativity is disappearing everywhere. Everything is being flattened out into an object of consumption.   
   
Today, we live in an increasingly narcissistic society. Libido is primarily invested in one’s own subjectivity. Narcissism is not the same as self-love. The subject of selflove draws a negative boundary between him- or herself and the Other. The narcissistic subject, on the other hand, never manages to set any clear boundaries. In consequence, the border between the narcissist and the Other becomes blurry. The world appears only as adumbrations of the narcissist’s self, which is incapable of recognizing the Other in his or her otherness — much less acknowledging this otherness for what it is. Meaning can exist for the narcissistic self only when it somehow catches sight of itself. It wallows in its own shadow everywhere until it drowns — in itself.   
   
Depression is a narcissistic malady. It derives from overwrought, pathologically distorted self-reference. The narcissistic-depressive subject has exhausted itself and worn itself down. Without a world to inhabit, it has been abandoned by the Other. Eros and depression are opposites. Eros pulls the subject out of itself, toward the Other. Depression, in contrast, plunges the subject into itself. Today’s narcissistic “achievement-subject” seeks out success above all. Finding success validates the One through the Other. Thereby, the Other is robbed of otherness and degrades into a mirror of the One — a mirror affirming the latter’s image. This logic of recognition ensnares the narcissistic achievement-subject more deeply in the ego. The corollary is success-induced depression: the depressive achievement-subject sinks into, and suffocates in, itself. Eros, in contrast, makes possible experience of the Other’s otherness, which leads the One out of a narcissistic inferno. It sets into motion freely willed self-renunciation, freely willed self-evacuation. A singular process of weakening lays hold of the subject of love — which, however, is accompanied by a feeling of strength. This feeling is not the achievement of the One, but the gift of the Other.   
   
In the inferno of the same, the arrival of the atopic Other can assume apocalyptic form. In other words: today, only an apocalypse can liberate —indeed, redeem— us from the inferno of the same, and lead us toward the Other.   
   
Eros —erotic desire— conquers depression. It delivers us from the inferno of the same to the atopia, indeed the utopia, of the wholly Other.   
   
> Suppose this: the child —is he seven years old, or eight perhaps?— standing by the window, drawing the curtain and, through the pane, looking…   
> What happens then: the sky, the same sky suddenly open, absolutely black and absolutely empty, revealing… such an absence that all has since always and forevermore been lost… — …the vertiginous knowledge that nothing is what there is, and first of all nothing beyond. The unexpected… is the feeling of happiness that straightaway submerges the child, the ravaging joy to which he can bear witness only by tears, and endless flood of tears… He says nothing. He will live henceforth in the secret. He will weep no more.   
   
The child Maurice Blanchot describes is enraptured by the infinity of the barren sky, torn out of himself and emptied (entinnerlicht) into an atopic Outside, dissolved and drained. The disastrous event (Ereignis) —this invasion of the Exterior and wholly Other— unfolds as dispossession (Ent-Eignis), an annulment and voiding of the Own; that is, it unfolds as death: “the sky’s emptiness: the disaster as withdrawal outside the sidereal abode.”4 And yet, disaster fills the child with “ravaging joy” — indeed, with the happiness of absence. Herein lies the dialectic of the disaster, which also structures Melancholia. Catastrophic fatality abruptly switches over into salvation.   
   
## Being Able Not to Be Able   
   
Achievement society is wholly dominated by the modal verb can — in contrast to disciplinary society, which issues prohibitions and deploys should. After a certain point of productivity, should reaches a limit. To increase productivity, it is replaced by can. The call for motivation, initiative, and projects exploits more effectively than whips and commands. As an entrepreneur of the self, the achievement-subject is free insofar as he or she is not subjugated to a commanding and exploiting Other. However, the subject is still not really free because he or she now engages in self-exploitation — and does so of his or her own free will. The exploiter is the exploited. The achievement-subject is perpetrator and victim in one. Auto-exploitation proves much more efficient than allo-exploitation because it is accompanied by a feeling of liberty. This makes possible exploitation without domination.   
   
Foucault observes that neoliberal Homo oeconomicus does not inhabit disciplinary society —an entrepreneur of the self is no longer a disciplinary subject1— but he fails to notice that this entrepreneur of the self is not truly free: Homo oeconomicus only thinks himself free when in fact he is exploiting himself.   
   
Auto-compulsion proves more fatal than allo-compulsion, because there is no way to resist oneself. The neoliberal regime conceals its compulsive structure behind the seeming freedom of the single individual, who no longer understands him- or herself as a subjugated subject (“subject to”), but as a project in the process of realizing itself (entwerfendes Projekt). That is its ruse: now, whoever fails is at fault and personally bears the guilt. No one else can be made responsible for failure. Nor is there any possibility for pardon, relief, or atonement. In this way, not only a crisis of debt occurs — a crisis of gratification does, as well.   
   
Relief from debt, financial and psychological, and gratification both presume the Other. Lack of a binding connection to the Other is the transcendental condition for crises of gratification and debt. Such crises make it plain that capitalism —counter to widespread belief (e.g., Benjamin)— is not a religion. Every religion operates with both debt (guilt) and relief (pardon). But capitalism only works with debt and default.   
Together with burnout, depression represents an unredeemable failure of ability — that is, it amounts to psychic insolvency. Literally, “insolvency” (from the Latin solvere) signifies the impossibility of paying off a debt.   
   
Today, love is being positivized into sexuality, and, by the same token, subjected to a commandment to perform. Sex means achievement and performance. And sexiness represents capital to be increased. The body —with its display value— has become a commodity. At the same time, the Other is being sexualized into an object for procuring arousal. When otherness is stripped from the Other, one cannot love — one can only consume. To this extent, the Other is no longer a person; instead, he or she has been fragmented into sexual part-objects. There is no such thing as a sexual personality.   
   
When the Other is perceived as a sexual object, “primal distance” (Urdistanz) erodes; Martin Buber claims that such distance serves as the very “principle of being-human” and constitutes the transcendental condition for any alterity existing at all.6 “Primal distantiation” prevents the Other from being reified into an object, an “it.” The Other as sexual object is no longer a “Thou.” It is impossible to have a relationship with it. Primal distance brings forth the transcendental dignity and propriety that frees —that is, distances— the Other into his or her otherness. Precisely this is what makes it possible to address the Other properly. One can call up, or out to, a sex object, but one cannot address it. A sex object also has no “countenance,” which is what constitutes alterity: the otherness of the Other commands distance.   
   
Today, more and more, dignity, decency, and propriety —matters of maintaining distance— are disappearing. That is, the ability to experience the Other in terms of his or her otherness is being lost. By means of social media, we seek to bring the Other as near as possible, to close any distance between ourselves and him or her, to create proximity.   
   
Today, love is being positivized into a formula for enjoyment. Above all, love is supposed to generate pleasant feelings. It no longer represents plot, narration, or drama — only inconsequential emotion and arousal. It is free from the negativity of injury, assault, or crashing. To fall (in love) would already be too negative. Yet it is precisely such negativity that constitutes love: “Love is not a possibility, is not due to our initiative, is without reason; it invades and wounds us.”7 Achievement society —which is dominated by ability, and where everything is possible and everything occurs as an initiative and a project— has no access to love as something that wounds or incites passion.   
   
Thus, the partners determine in advance that they will not exceed “hard limits”. Socalled safewords guarantee that activities do not go beyond certain boundaries. The overuse of the adjective “delicious” throughout the novel points to the dictate of positivity, which transforms everything into a formula for enjoyment and consumption. Even torture can be “delicious” in Fifty Shades of Grey. This world of positivity admits only things that can be consumed. Pain itself is supposed to be enjoyable. Here, negativity —which manifests itself as pain in Hegel— no longer exists at all.   
   
The present that stands at one’s disposal is the temporality of the Same. In contrast, the future lies open to the event, which is absolutely surprising. Our relationship to futurity concerns the atopic Other, which cannot be assimilated into the language of the Same.   
Memory is not an organ of simple restitution, by means of which one makes the past present again. In memory, what has been is constantly changing. It is a progressive, living, narrative process. In this, it differs from data storage. Technological data storage strips all life from what has been. It is without time.   
Time without moments is merely additive and no longer situative. As the temporality of the click, it lacks decision and resolve. The blink of an eye is yielding to pointing-and-clicking.   
   
Today, love —which now means nothing more than need, satisfaction, and enjoyment— is incompatible with the withdrawal and delay of the Other. Society, as a search engine, a machine for consumption, is abolishing the desire for what is absent — what cannot be found, seized, and consumed. Yet eros awakens only in view of the “countenance” that “at once gives and conceals the Other.”13 The “countenance” stands diametrically opposed to the “face” that holds no secrets, which exhibits itself in pornographic nakedness and hands itself over to total visibility and consumption.   
   
the Other: sacrosanct, atopic otherness, which, in today’s increasingly narcissistic society, is vanishing.   
   
## Bare Life   
   
“For those eyes of yours, gliding through my eyes to the depths of my heart, stir the hottest fire in my marrow. Therefore, have mercy on me, who die because of you.” [^1]   
   
According to Ficino, love is the “most serious disease of all”; a “change,” it “takes away from a man that which is his own and changes him into the nature of another.”   
Such injury and transformation constitute its negativity. Today, through the increasing positivization and domestication of love, it is disappearing entirely. One stays the same and seeks only the confirmation of oneself in the Other.   
   
In Consuming the Romantic Utopia, Eva Illouz claims that love is now becoming “feminized.” Adjectives used to describe romantic love-scenes —“nice,” “intimate,” “quiet,” “peaceful,” “comfortable,” “sweet,” “gentle,” and so on— are extremely “feminine.” The prevailing image of romantic love makes men and women alike occupy a female sphere of sentiment.5 But counter to Illouz’s diagnosis, love is not simply being “feminized.” Rather, in the course of a positivization of all spheres of life, it is being domesticated into a consumer formula devoid of risk and daring, without excess or madness. All negativity, all negative feeling, is avoided. Passion and pain are giving way to pleasant feelings and inconsequential arousal. In the age of the “quickie,” the casual encounter, and sex as stress-relief, sexuality is losing all negativity, too. The wholesale absence of negativity is degrading love into an object of consumption, a matter of hedonistic calculation. The desire for the Other is giving way to the comfort of the Same. The aim is to procure the comfortable and, ultimately, dull immanence of the wholly identical. Modern love lacks all transcendence and transgression.   
   
Hegel’s dialectic of master and slave describes the battle for life and death. The party who emerges as master does not fear death. The desire for freedom, recognition, and sovereignty raises the master above concern for bare life. It is fear of dying that induces the future slave to subordinate himself to the Other. Preferring servitude to the threat of death, the slave clings to bare life. Physical superiority does not determine the outcome of the struggle. Instead, what proves decisive is the “ability to die,” or a capacity for death. Those who do not have freedom unto death do not risk their life. Instead of “following through to the point of death”, they remain “standing alone within death”. The slave does not venture as far as death, and therefore becomes a vassal who labors.
