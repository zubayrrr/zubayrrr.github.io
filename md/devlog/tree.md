> In UNIX/LINUX systems, as well as MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows, tree is a recursive directory listing program that produces a depth-indented listing of files. With no arguments, tree lists the files in the current directory. When directory arguments are given, tree lists all the files or directories found in the given directories each in turn. Upon completion of listing all files and directories found, tree returns the total number of files and directories listed.   
   
## Syntax   
   
> `tree -d path` to return only directories   
   
`tree -f path` to return absolute path of directories
