I think there is a version of masculinity that all men should be taught by their fathers — a healthy kind of it.   
   
I do acknowledge that there are certain things that do count as “toxic” — I can’t really quantify it for now but I get  that from these so called Alpha males, sigma male masquerading people.   
   
I am perfectly secure about my masculinity — okay, maybe not PERFECTLY but I am trying to understand it.   
   
I do subscribe to the idea that men should be “providers” but I don’t want this to coincide with “Women should stay at home” — at least, not in this economy.   
   
I actively encourage women around me to be better, how they can find better employment opportunities etc.   
   
I guess I wouldn’t shy away from calling myself a feminist if it means equal opportunity in work, education, in all the other aspects of life and pay(but I’ve heard from many people that women are often paid less because they’re not as efficient in their work as their counterpart in a given field).   
   
Also, I am really weirded out by women not wanting to shave their armpits in the name of feminism.   
   
But I am all for equality.   
   
Why do I wanna learn more about masculinity?   
   
I do sort of admire traditional values such as being disciplined, taking yourself seriously, working out, wanting to bring out the best version of yourself, being respected among your peers(I’ve known men who are only invited to hang out so others can make fun of them).    
   
I think the versions of this kind of masculinity has been talked about by YTers like Hamza or Sindbad.   
   
But I wanna learn more about things like courage, doing what not what is right or wrong but what your duty is, confidence, family values(like serving your parents when they’re old because they literally helped you come into this world, I really believe you don’t owe shit to anyone in this world except your parents — I guess not for everybody, I have heard stories of abusive and asshole parents but mine raised me well).   
   
But some of the things they teach like — how to “get” chicks to like you and how you can be a fuckboy are things I am really NOT after.   
   
I think it’s a waste of time to fuck around with multiple women just for the sake of it. I’d much rather spend time and energy making a relationship work with a person I actually like.   
   
So what should I actually explore, what should I read?   
   
There's books like The Rational Male by Rollo Tomassi teaching but I really don’t wanna go down the path of the playboy.   
   
When I said I am fairly confident and secure about my masculinity, it mostly comes from the fact that I’ve been working out for a couple of years(not consistently but I know a thing or two about lifting), the fact that I’ve actively but effort into “personal development” and self-awareness gives me enough confidence everyday but I want to prepare myself for my thirties — for a twenty year old I have done fairly well in these bizarre times.   
   
I also have to start thinking about marriage and family soon. Which I’ve been avoiding to think about for a long time. … how am I going to raise my children?   
   
I guess masculinity is also about charisma — which I did read about in her [The Charisma Myth](/not_created.md): How Anyone Can Master the Art and Science of Personal Magnetism by Olivia Fox Cabane — read it a few years ago, need a refresher on it.   
   
You know just don’t want my opinion to end up on [https://twitter.com/MasculineTakes](https://twitter.com/MasculineTakes)    
   
I honestly don’t think there’s much to be learnt here, I already have my [values](../topics/Values.md) and `{_obsidian_pattern_tag_principles}` guiding me and will guide my through my life, I’d much rather worry about them than worry if I am masculine enough or not. I am a fond subscriber to the philosophy of [stoicism](../topics/stoicism.md), I don’t need this convoluted Alpha-Beta-Sigma male BS.
