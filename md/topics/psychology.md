These are the three main questions that psychology is concerned with as well:   
   
   
- Why do people do what they do?   
- What are the component parts of why and how?   
- How do people do what they do?   
   
So it’s finally time to define it: Psychology is the scientific study of human behavior and   
mental processes. Psychology attempts to uncover what people do along with why,   
what, and how they do it.   
   
   
- People are not “models,” but the models can be helpful in understanding people!   
- If they can cause it to happen, then they can un-cause it to happen, too. And that means they understand why and how it’s happening. This is a type of reverse psychological engineering for figuring out the why, what, and how questions of human behavior. (It’s also a good example of an empirical approach in as much as the process is observable and testable.)   
- Knowing what a person's functions are. The foundations of this function approach are built on a philosophy know as functionalism, which is the notion that the mind, mental processes, and behavior are “tools” for adaptive functioning that lead to a human functioning most effectively in his or her environment (survival and perpetuation of the species).   
- It is obvious that psychology can be very reductionist. That is, it tries to take an extremely complex phenomenon, people, and break it down into parts and simple explanations. We’ve broken apart Humpty Dumpty, but can we put him back together again? People are not made up of X, Y, and Z. People are not just whys, whats, and hows. We’re not theories, models, experiments, or Dr. Cash’s “monsters.”   
- Each of us is an amateur psychologist of sorts. Professional psychologists aren’t the only ones who try to figure people out, we all do!

## Metatheory and Frameworks   
   
Psychologists as a group have come up with a basic set of broad theoretical perspectives, or frameworks, to guide the work of psychology. These broad theoretical frameworks are sometimes referred to as metatheories.   
   
   
- Biological   
   
The biological approach centers on the biological underpinnings of behavior, including the effects of evolution and genetics. Biological psychologists focus mostly on the brain and the nervous system. Neuropsychology and the study of the brain, genetics, and evolutionary psychology are included within the biological metatheory.   
   
   
- Behaviorism   
   
Behaviorism emphasizes the role and influence of a person’s environment and previous learning experiences to understanding behavior. Behaviorists don’t traditionally focus on mental processes per se because they believe that mental pro- cesses are too difficult to observe and measure objectively. In the framework of behaviorism, the “why” of behavior can be explained by looking at the circum- stances in which it occurs and the consequences surrounding someone’s actions. Classical conditioning and operant conditioning are ways of understanding behavior and they lead to behavior modification, a specific approach to modifying behavior, and helping people change that comes from the metatheory of behaviorism.   
   
   
- Cognitive   
   
The cognitive framework centers on the mental processing of information, including the specific functions of attention, concentration, reasoning, problem solving, and memory. Cognitive psychologists are interested in the mental plans and thoughts that guide and cause behavior and affect how people feel. Intelligence testing and information-processing theories are examples that fall within the cognitive metatheory.   
   
People can change the way they think about a situation. You can choose to look on the bright side — or at least not look solely at the downside. That’s the gist of cognitive therapy.   
   
   
- Sociocultural   
   
The sociocultural approach focuses on the social and cultural factors that affect behavior. Therefore, as you might expect, social and cross-cultural psychology fall within the sociocultural metatheory, which is all about the enormous power of groups and culture on the why, how, and what of behavior and mental processes.   
   
   
- Developmental   
   
The Greek philosopher Heraclitus is credited with saying, “The only constant in   
life is change.” Developmental psychology is a metatheory that is built on the idea that mental processes and behavior change over time, from one mental process and behavior to another in a progressive manner. Mental processes are built from and upon previous ones. Behaviors are built from and upon previous ones.   
   
   
- Evolutionary   
   
Evolutionary psychology searches for the causes and explanations for mental processes and behavior through the lens of adaptive fitness and natural selection. The basic idea is that mental processes and behaviors are the product of the “selection through mating” for processes and behaviors that helped solve recurring prob- lems facing humans across large swathes of time. Whereas developmental approaches emphasize change over the lifespan of an individual, evolutionary psychology emphasizes change over generations. Traits that were particularly helpful for survival, such as problem-solving and cooperating with others were “kept” and passed on to subsequent generations. Mental process or behavior that led to a person living long enough to pass on his or her genes stayed in the gene pool. Those that did not were dropped from the gene pool. Additionally, there is a branch of psychology known as comparative psychology that studies animal behavior as an analog for human behavior. Studying animals can help us understand humans, and evolutionary psychology is the foundation of and justification for this approach.   
   
   
- Humanistic and existential   
   
The humanistic and existential metatheory emphasizes that each person is unique and that humans have the ability and responsibility to make choices in their lives. I’m not a victim of circumstance! I have choices in my life. Humanists believe that a person’s free choice, free will, and understanding of the meaning of events in his or her life are the most important things to study in order to understand behavior. The works of Victor Frankl, Rollo May, and Fritz Perls along with the study of spirituality and religion are examples that fall within this framework.   
   
Psychologists who work within the humanistic and existential metatheory believe that behavior is simply a result of choice.   
   
   
- Psychoanalytic/psychodynamic   
   
The psychoanalytic/psychodynamic metatheory emphasizes the importance of unconscious mental processes, early child development, personality, the self, attachment patterns, and relationships. This approach explores how these mental and developmental processes interact with the challenges of life and everyday demands to affect the person you are and how you behave. [sigmund freud](../resources/people/sigmund%20freud.md) founded psychoanalysis in the early 1900s; since then, hundreds of theorists have added to his work. The later theories are typically labeled psychodynamic because they emphasize the dynamic interplay between various components of mind, the self, personality, others, and reality. Object Relations Theory and Self Psychology are two specific theoretical perspectives that fall within the psychoanalytic/psychodynamic metatheory.   
   
   
- Postmodernism   
   
The Postmodern metatheory questions the very core of psychological science, challenging its approach to truth and its focus on the individual. Postmodernists propose, for example, that in order to understand human thinking and reason,need to look at the social and communal processes involved in thinking and reason. Reality is not something that is out there independently; it is something that humans, as a community, create. Postmodernists make the argument that people in powerful positions have too much to say about what is “real” and “true” in psychology, and they advocatesocial constructionist view of reality, which states that the concepts of “reality” and “truth” are defined, or constructed, by society. These concepts, according to this framework, have no meaning apart from the meanings that society and its experts assign to them. Narrative and constructionist theories are examples that fall within the metatheory of Postmodernism.   
   
   
- Biopsychosocial Model   
   
One alternative to picking a metatheory is to combine several views together, thus adopting an integrationist or unifying approach. The biopsychosocial model of psychology represents a popular attempt at integration. The basic idea behind this model is that human behavior and mental processes are the products of:   
   
1. biological   
2. psychological   
3. social influences   
   
Biopsychosocialists try to find out how these influences interact to produce behavior. They believe that any explanation of behavior and mental processes that doesn’t consider all three primary factors (body, mind, and environment) is incomplete.   
   
   
---   
   
Psychologists accept that the mind exists in, or is synonymous with, the brain.   
The biological metatheory is integrated into the biopsychosocial model because of this component. You may say that, just as digestion is what the stomach does, “mind” is what the brain does.   
   
Brains don’t work and minds don’t think in a vacuum. Behavior and mental pro-   
cesses are embedded within a context that includes other people and things in the environment in which people live. Therefore, the social aspect of the biopsychosocial model also includes parent-child relationships, families, communities, and culture. Overlooking the impact of a person’s interaction with family and friends is to neglect reality. Just as the influence of family and friend relations is critical, it is also vital that psychologists consider cultural differences.   
   
## Nature VS Nurture   
   
Nature refers to the concept that behavior and mental processes are innate, inborn, and hard-wired and will unfold over time as a person develops and her genetic blueprint is revealed. Nurture refers to the idea that behavior and mental processes are not inborn and instead are learned from the environment in which people live.   
   
John Locke, a 17th-century British philosopher, espoused the concept of tabula rasa, the “blank slate” and believed that, given the right learning experiences, a person can become anything in life. On the other side is Charles Darwin, the father of evolution and nature advocate, who believed that a person’s destiny is found in his or her biology and genes.   
   
Most modern psychologists consider this debate over. The simple answer is that both nature and nurture impact a person’s behavior and level of success. This means that making sense of what people do and why they do it is ultimately accomplished only by investigating and understanding the relative contributions of innate biological influences and learned environmental influences

A theory is a set of related statements about a set of objects or events (the ones being studied) that explains how these objects or events are related. Knowing this is important because a significant amount of psychological knowledge is based on theory. Theories perform two main functions: They combine what is already known into a simpler package of knowledge and they help psychologists plan future investigations: Theories summarize and guide.   
   
Theories and hypotheses are similar but not exactly the same thing. Psychologists test theories by studying their logical implications. Hypotheses are specific predictions based on these implications. You can add new information to theories, and you can use existing theories to generate new ones. Not every theory is a good theory.   
   
In order for a theory to be good, it must meet three criteria:   
   
   
- Parsimony: It must be the simplest explanation possible that still explains the available observation.   
- Precision: It must make precise, not overly large or vague, statements about reality.   
- Testability: It must lend itself to scientific investigation. There must be some way to show that the theory can be wrong. It is easy to collect more information consistent with one’s theory. It is braver to be a scientist: to examine situations that may prove one’s theory wrong.

The Falsification Principle, proposed by Karl Popper, is a way of demarcating science from non-science. It suggests that for a theory to be considered scientific it must be able to be tested and conceivably proven false.   
For example, the hypothesis that "all swans are white," can be falsified by observing a black swan.   
For Popper, science should attempt to disprove a theory, rather than attempt to continually support theoretical hypotheses.   
   
[Karl Popper](/not_created.md) argued that science would best progress using [deductive reasoning](/not_created.md) (as opposed to [inductive reasoning](/not_created.md)) as its primary emphasis, known as critical rationalism.

Psychologists strive to maintain their expertise and knowledge through the use of three forms of knowledge acquisition or ways of knowing:   
   
   
- Authority: Utilized to transmit information, usually in a therapy setting or the education and training process. Patients and students don’t have time to go out and research everything that they’re told. They have to take someone’s word for it at some point.   
- Rationalism/logic: Used to create theories and hypotheses. If things don’t make logical sense, they probably won’t make sense when researchers use the scientific method to investigate them.   
- Scientific method: Used as the preferred method of obtaining information and investigating behavior and mental processes. Psychologists implement the scientific method through a variety of different techniques.   
   
A good-sized chunk of information that’s out there is also purely theoretical, but it makes sense on rational or logical grounds.   
   
   
---   
   
Psychologists use two broad categories of research when they want to scientifically evaluate a theory: descriptive research and experimental research.   
   
Descriptive research consists of observation and the collection of data without trying to manipulate any of the conditions or circumstances being observed. They don’t help much if you’re interested in cause and effect relationships.   
   
Experimental research involves the control and manipulation of the objects and events being investigated in order to get a better idea of the cause and effect relationships between the objects or events.   
   
A z-factor is something affecting the hypothesis that I am unaware of or not accounting for. It is an extraneous variable that I need to control in order to have confidence in my theory. Good research studies try to eliminate z-factors or extraneous variables by controlling for their influence and factoring them out of the explanation.

Generally, two types of statistical analyses are used in psychology, descriptive and inferential:   
   

   
Statistics is concerned with the rules of data collection and analysis.   
   
## Statistics used in Psychology   
   
   
- Descriptive statistics   
   
refer to the direct numerical measurement of characteristics of a population such as how many of something there are, what the average number of some phenomenon is, or what the range of a particular value of something is. I am describing what is there, but not going beyond the data. If I conduct descriptive statistics on all swans to test my hypothesis that all swans are white, I would have to describe every swan. Formally, a population is defined as a well-defined, complete collection of things, objects, and so on. A descriptive analysis requires a description of the entire swan population.   
   
   
- Inferential statistics   
   
comes to the rescue when I can’t measure all swans, because this approach allows me to measure a sample of swans, a subset of the swan population, and then make inferences or estimates about the population as a whole from the sample that was drawn. Inferential statistics solves the measurement dilemma as long, of course, as you follow some basic rules such as randomization and appropriate sample size.   
   
Randomization allows researchers to make inferences about a population based on the way a sample is chosen. Every member of the population must have the same chance of being in the sample.   
   
Another key ingredient to ensuring that your sample is representative of the population is sample size, the number or n of individuals in your sample   
   
## the “N of One” problem   
   
A sample size of one, from a statistical perspective isn't likely to represent the population as a whole? Correspondingly, this is why most people are more likely to trust advice if the same data comes from multiple people.
   
   
   
---   
   
## Correlation VS Causation   
   
A variable is the thing, characteristic, behavior, or mental process that is being measured or observed. Psychologists are interested in how variables relate, that is how do the things that are measured affect, impact, or alter each other?   
   
In research, there are two types of variables, independent and dependent. A dependent variable is the thing that is   
impacted or altered as a function of the independent variable. The independent variable impacts the dependent variable as it changes. The value of the dependent variable is directly caused or influenced by the independent variable.   
   
Does that mean that if two variables are related that there is a causal relationship?   
No, sometimes variables can be involved in a non-causal manner known as a correlation or a correlational relationship. A correlation exists between two ­variables when the value of one is related to the value of the other but not necessarily in a causal manner.   
   
A correlation can be mistaken for causation(conjecture); just because two variables are related does not mean that one causes the other to happen. Correlation, not causation.   
   
## The Placebo Effect   
   
When psychologists want to test the impact of independent variables on dependent variables. They go with a simple   
experimental and control group approach. An experimental group is the group that is getting the independent variable, and the control group is not; it is getting nothing in essence.   
   
There is another variation of this approach that is often used to help make the impact of the independent variable stand out more. This is done by using a **placebo group** in addition to the control group. A placebo is a decoy variable of sorts, a fake independent variable that is **not** expected to have an impact on the dependent variable, but the person in the study thinks it is an actual treatment or independent variable.   
   
The placebo group quite often shows change or improvement. This is known as the placebo effect, when an experimental   
effect is related to the presence of the placebo. A fascinating phenomenon is one that scientists from all fields are trying to learn more about but have not quite figured out yet.

Most scientists today hold the position that the mind and the brain are one and the same. Scientists taking this position, known as [monism](/not_created.md), believe that in order to achieve the most full understanding of mental processes and behavior, we have to include the brain and the body in that formulation, acknowledging the very reality that we have brains and bodies in which mental processes and behavior “live.”   
   
Psychologist Neil Carlson states, “What we call the ‘mind’ is a consequence of the functioning of the human body and its interactions with the environment.” This is a powerful idea — the key to unlocking the mysteries of such psychological concepts as thinking and feeling lies in a thorough understanding of human biology.
   
   
The idea that all of human psychology can be reduced to biology is known as biological reductionism.   
   
This idea seems to insult our closely guarded and esteemed sense of free will, self-awareness, and consciousness. how can all this complex stuff going on inside my mind be reduced to a hunk of flesh resting between my ears?   
   
We can’t escape our brains and genes, so biology and psychology are stuck with each other. But this relationship doesn’t have to be contentious as long as we adopt the monist stance.   
   

   
The human nervous system consists of two large divisions: the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS). The CNS includes the brain and spinal cord. The PNS includes the nerves outside the CNS; they are in the rest (the periphery) of the body. The basic building blocks of the nervous system are nerves, neurons, and neu- rotransmitters and glial cells.   
   
Neurochemical electrical changes throughout the nervous system serve as a basic mechanism for psychological functions.Because these electrical changes involve the movement of chemical ions, the transmission system is called an electrochemical system.   
   
Neurotransmitters are chemicals that play a critical role in transmitting signals between neurons. The glial cells are cells within the nervous system that plays a variety of support roles for the neurons; they protect neurons from damage, repair them when they are damaged, and remove damaged or dead tissue when it can’t be repaired   
   
Some scientists propose that the biological study of the brain is really the study of neurons in networks. This approach is known as the neurocomputational approach to brain functioning. It’s “computational” because these researchers base their models of brain function- ing on the calculation processes of neurons in networks as they interact with each other by turning each other on and off with electrochemical signaling.   
   
Scientists look at the nervous system in two basic ways: anatomical organization and functional organization. Looking at the nervous system from an anatomical (or anatomy) viewpoint essentially focuses on the parts, and the functional organization view is concerned with what those parts do with respect to mental processes and behavior.   
   
A neuron is considered the information cell; it’s involved in the processing and storage of information. Neurons contain the following parts:   
   
   
- Soma: The cell body of the neuron containing the nucleus and supportive structures of the cell, including the mitochondria   
- Dendrite: Projections from the cell body that receive information from other neurons   
- Axon: The nerve fiber that conducts the electrical impulse   
- Terminal button: The end of the axon involved in neurotransmitter release and signaling to other neurons   
   
when information from the environment (or inside the brain itself from other neurons) comes into the brain through the sensory organs and activates a particular neuron (or, more often, a set of neurons), an action potential is created.   
   
Action potentials are the movement of electrochemical energy through a neuron toward its terminal button, toward other neurons. Something called the all-or-none law states that neurons are either “on” or “off”; they are either firing an action potential or not. After a neuron is activated, it fires. If it’s not activated: no action, no fire! It’s electrochemical.   
   
When a neuron is not firing, it is considered to be in the state of a resting potential and its electrical charge is more negative on the inside relative to the outside.   
   
When a neuron receives a signal from another neuron, gates in the cell membrane (its covering) open and positive ions rush into the negatively charged inside of the cell. When the action potential occurs, the cell cannot fire again for a short period of time. During this refractory period, small pumps in the cell membrane work to reset the neuron by moving positive ions back out of the cell, returning the chemical balance of the neuron to its original state to prepare for another round of action.   
   
Neurons don’t actually connect to each other in a physical sense. There are gaps between them known as synapse, spaces between axon terminals of one neuron (the neuron sending the signal) and the dendrites of the next neuron (the neuron receiving the signal); this is where inter-neuronal ­communication happens through chemical messengers called neurotransmitters. Although they are only millionths of an inch apart, the sending neuron throws its “message in a bottle” into the synapse, where it drifts to the other shore (the receiving dendrite).   
   
Neurotransmitters are stored in the axon of the sending cell. An action potential stimulates their release into the synapse. They travel (actually drift) to a receiving neuron in which specialized docks known as receptor sites are present. Different shaped neurotransmitters have different docks.   
   
Basically, neurotransmitters have one of two effects; they either excite the receiving neuron (make it more likely to fire) or inhibit the receiving neuron (make it less likely to fire). Some neurotransmitters are excitatory and some are inhibitory. Whether a particular neuron fires (transmits a signal) depends on the balance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters.   
   
Scientists have discovered more than 100 neurotransmitters in the human brain.   
Many, including the following, play a major role:   
   
   
- [Glutamate](../archive/glutamate.md): The most common excitatory neurotransmitter   
- GABA: The most common inhibitory transmitter; involved in eating, aggression, and sleep   
- Acetylcholine: A common neurotransmitter with multiple excitatory and inhibitory functions; involved in movement and memory   
   
Another group of four chemically similar neurotransmitters modify behavior in many ways. These neurotransmitters are particularly important regarding psychological disorders:   
   
   
- Serotonin: An inhibitory transmitter that is involved in balancing excitatory transmitters as well as mood, sleep, eating, and pain   
- Dopamine: Can be either inhibitory or excitatory and is implicated in attention, pleasure and reward, and movement   
- Epinephrine: An excitatory transmitter related to stress responses, heart rate,   
  and blood pressure   
   
- Norepinephrine: An excitatory transmitter involved in energy regulation, anxiety, and fear   
   
Following the docking process, neurotransmitters are either broken down by enzymes or reabsorbed by the sending neurons in a process called reuptake. These two processes clear neurotransmitters from the synapse after they have done their job   
   
Neurotransmitter manipulation is a primary mechanism of action for most psychiatric medications.   
   
An estimated 86 billion neurons live in the human brain and form trillions of connections among themselves.   
   
The brain is a “massively parallel” information-processing system. If each neuron was connected to only one other neuron, the neuron system would be considered “massively serial.” Compared to electronic signals, neural signals travel very slowly (like 5–100 mph), so it is efficient to do many things at once — called [parallel processing](/not_created.md).   
   
Not every neuron is connected to every other neuron, but neurons are connected to multiple others that form clusters or networks involved in particular psychological processes and behaviors.

Brain develops from bottom to top and from back to front. This order reflects the evolutionary age of the areas of the brain. The oldest parts of the brain—the ones also present in our ancient ancestors and animal cousins—develop first, at the base of the brain near the spine. They control breathing, senses, emotions, sex, pleasure, sleep, hunger and thirst, or the “animal propensities”. Roughly speaking, these areas are what we consider to be the emotional brain.   
   
The most forward part of the brain—literally and figuratively—is the frontal lobe, located just behind the forehead. The most recent part of the brain to have evolved in humans, it is also the final area of the brain to mature in each individual. Nicknamed the “executive functioning center” and the “seat of civilization,” the frontal lobe is where reason and judgment reside. It is where rational thoughts balance, and regulate, the feelings and impulses of the emotional brain.   
   
The area of the brain that processes probability and time, the frontal lobe is also where we tackle uncertainty. This allows us to think not only about the present but also about the future. It is where we quiet our emotions long enough to anticipate the likely consequences of our behavior and plan accordingly for tomorrow, even though no outcome is certain and the future is unknown. This front part of the brain is where we do our [forward thinking](../archive/Forward%20Thinking.md).   
   
Consider twentieth- and twenty-first-century patients with frontal lobe damage, several of whom have been written about extensively. What stands out about these patients is that, although their intellect is unchanged and their ability to solve concrete problems remains intact, they show significant deficits in personal and social decision-making. They make choices in friends, partners, and activities that go against their own best interests. They find it difficult to see an abstract goal in terms of the concrete steps needed to reach it. They have trouble planning their days and their years.   
   
Historian Malcolm Macmillan suggests that Phineas Gage benefited from a sort of “social recovery.” The regular routines of stagecoach driving allowed Gage’s frontal lobe to relearn many of the skills compromised in the accident. The experiences he had, day in and day out, allowed Gage to again be personally and socially deliberate, to again be forward-thinking.   
   
Thus, [swipes.stories.Phineas Gage](/not_created.md) provided doctors not only with some of the earliest information about the functional areas of the brain but also with some of the earliest evidence of the brain’s plasticity. Gage’s social recovery, and countless subsequent studies of the brain, tell us that the brain changes in response to the environment. This is especially true in the twentysomething years as the brain caps off its second—and final—growth spurt.   
   
   
---   
   
In the first eighteen months of life, the brain experiences its first growth spurt, producing far more neurons than it can use. The infant brain overprepares, readying itself for whatever life brings, such as to speak any language within earshot. This is how we go from being one-year-olds who understand fewer than one hundred words to being six-year-olds who know more than ten thousand.   
   
But this same rapid overproduction of neurons creates an overly crowded network, and this leads to cognitive inefficiency, which is not adaptive. That’s why these same spongelike toddlers struggle to string together a few words in a sentence, and they forget to put on their socks before their shoes. Potential and confusion rule the day. To make neural networks more efficient, this first growth spurt is followed by pruning. Across years, the brain keeps the neurons and connections that are used while those that are neglected are pruned, or allowed to die off.

The connectome is the complete description of the structural connectivity (the physical wiring) of an organism's nervous system. The field of science dealing with the assembly, mapping and analysis of data on neural connections is called connectomics.
