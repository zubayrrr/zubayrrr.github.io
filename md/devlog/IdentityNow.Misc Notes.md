Think of IdentityNow as the internal access and governance system that you use to raise entitlement requests and other access requests BUT on steriods.   
Predefined roles and other associated information can be used to populate information when onboarding a new user and for special cases, requests can be raised for individual service, tools etc.   
   
The requests raised will be approved or denied by the approver(usually the manager of the employee is the approver).   
   
Once approved, it’ll automatically provision the access, there’s no communication that happens with an admin that manually grants the access.   
   
Think of [Okta](../devlog/Okta.md) as an [SSO](../devlog/SSO.md) service such as Duo Security but a lot much granular in terms of control and authentication & authorization options.
