Intermittent fasting is an eating pattern where you alternate between periods of eating and fasting. There are many different ways to do intermittent fasting, but a common approach is to eat only during a certain window of time each day, such as 8 hours, and to fast for the remaining 16 hours. For example, you may choose to eat only between the hours of 12pm and 8pm, and then fast for the rest of the day. Some people may choose to do this every day, while others may do it a few days per week.   
   
To start doing intermittent fasting, you can try the following steps:   
   
1.  Decide on a specific eating window that works for you. As mentioned above, 8 hours is a common option, but you can choose a different time frame that fits your schedule and preferences.   
2.  Stick to your eating window. During your designated eating window, eat three meals and one or two snacks, as needed. Make sure to eat enough to feel satisfied, but avoid overeating.   
3.  Don't eat or drink anything but water outside of your eating window. This means avoiding all food and drinks, except for water, during your fasting period. You can drink other calorie-free beverages, such as black coffee or tea, but avoid adding sugar or cream, as these can contain calories.   
4.  Continue this pattern on a regular basis. You can do intermittent fasting every day, or a few days per week, depending on what works best for you.
