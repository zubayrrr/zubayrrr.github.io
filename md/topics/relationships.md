## Sloww Hierarchy of Happiness – Relationships   
   
> The first is that social connections are really good for us, and that loneliness kills. It turns out that people who are more socially connected to family, to friends, to community, are happier, they’re physically healthier, and they live longer than people who are less well connected ... And we know that you can be lonely in a crowd and you can be lonely in a marriage, so the second big lesson that we learned is that it’s not just the number of friends you have, and it’s not whether or not you’re in a committed relationship, but it’s the quality of your close relationships that matters ... And the third big lesson that we learned about relationships and our health is that good relationships don’t just protect our bodies, they protect our brains.   
   
> Emotional happiness is primarily social ... The very best thing that can happen to people is to spend time with other people they like. That is when they are happiest. — Dr. Daniel Kahneman   
   
> One of the best ways to make yourself happy is to make other people happy; one of the best ways to make other people happy is to be happy yourself. — Gretchen Rubin

- Women go for good genes in the short term and for resources in the long term   
  - Women tend to prefer men who are physically fit   
  - symmetrical features   
  - masculine features(strong jawline, high shoulder to hip ratio)   
    - Shoulders should be wide relative to hips   
  - Well toned but not muscle bound   
  - Taller(above average, an inch or two)   
  - Women may interpret guys who are obsessed about their body with narcissism   
- Short term mating for women is not “one night stand”, its more affair mating.   
- Why do women have affairs?   
  - One theory suggests that they’re trying to get good genes from one partner and resources from the other.   
- When women have affairs, 70% of the time they get attached to their partner in crime   
  - But men only 30% of the time   
- Mating switching hypothesis   
  - affairs are one way women diversify themselves   
  - to transition into the mating market or to trade up   
- We’ve adaptations to switch mates for various (survival) reasons   
- In some cultures, a man’s hunting ability(resources) gives them high status   
  - In modern cultures on the other hand; cash economies are relatively recent, in the old times you weren’t able to stockpile resources.   
  - [steve pinker](../resources/people/steve%20pinker.md) said that you're storing meat in other people   
    - by which he means that if you provide for them (say, from your hunt) they'll reciprocate by providing for you
   
   
## Notes   
   
   
- Be an extreme version of yourself(don't try to not be a nerd, embrace that) - and ask out a lot of people.   
- People who are perpetually single are trying to date the small number of people that everyone else is trying to date   
- It's not lowering your standards, it's changing what your standards consists of. You're optimizing for the wrong parameters. You're wanting things that are not going to aid your goal of long term relationship.   
  - By doing this you're opening yourself up to an untapped new market with less competition that could bring happiness.   
- Take advantage of the [similarity bias](../archive/similarity%20bias.md) - similar traits are attractive.   
  - We're 11.3% more likely to match with someone who shares our initials.

## Quotes

The most important decision any of us make is who we marry. Yet there are no courses on how to choose a spouse. — David Brooks, political and cultural commentator   
   
> “Remarriage is the triumph of hope over experience” — Samuel Johnson   
   
> Other things may change us, but we start and end with family. — Anthony Brandt, writer   
   
> What counts in making a happy marriage is not so much how compatible you are, but how you deal with incompatibility. — Leo Tolstoy, writer
