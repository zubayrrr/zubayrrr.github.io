In quantum computing, Grover's algorithm, also known as the quantum search algorithm, refers to a quantum algorithm for unstructured search that finds with high probability the unique input to a black box function that produces a particular output value, using just {\displaystyle O({\sqrt {N}})}O({\sqrt {N}}) evaluations of the function, where {\displaystyle N}N is the size of the function's domain. It was devised by Lov Grover in 1996.
