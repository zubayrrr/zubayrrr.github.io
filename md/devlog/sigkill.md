The SIGKILL [signal](../devlog/signal.md)is sent to a [process](../devlog/process.md) to cause it to terminate immediately ([kill](../devlog/kill.md)). In contrast to [SIGTERM](../devlog/sigterm.md) and [SIGINT](/not_created.md), this signal cannot be caught or ignored, and the receiving process cannot perform any clean-up upon receiving this signal.
