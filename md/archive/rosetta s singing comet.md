A set of instruments on the European Space Agency's Rosetta spacecraft has picked up a mysterious "song" from Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. On Wednesday, Nov. 12, Rosetta will attempt the first-ever soft landing on a comet when it dispatches its Philae lander to the surface of comet 67P.     
   
The sounds are thought to be oscillations in the magnetic field around the comet. They were picked up by the Rosetta Plasma Consortium -- a suite of five instruments on the spacecraft that is orbiting the comet.     
   
An audio recording of the comet sounds is available at:  [https://soundcloud.com/esaops/a-singing-comet](https://soundcloud.com/esaops/a-singing-comet)     
   
The comet's song would not be audible to the human ear because it is being emitted at 40 to 50 millihertz, far below the range of human hearing, which typically picks up sound between 20 hertz and 20 kilohertz. To make the sounds audible to humans, Rosetta scientists have increased the frequencies by 10,000 times.
