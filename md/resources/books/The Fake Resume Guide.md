- Make a list of all the places you’ve already sent an application. What name did you use? Can you use another name if you reapply with your updated fake resume? For example if your name is Robert but you go by Bob and you used Robert in the first application then use Bob with the new fake resume when you send an application. Another idea is to use your middle name as your first name etc.   
- If you have concerns about the DOB being used as a tracer in the employer’s electronic system then do a single digit change in your DOB. Later during the hiring process you can use the correct DOB and claim it was a typographical error during the application process.   
- Before you allow any potential employer to call a past job for a reference it is essential to know in advance what will be said about you.The only way to find out is to call. Act as if you are a local small business and you are checking references on (then name yourself).   
- You must at all costs get beyond feeling wrong about your planned deception. To fake a resume successfully you must believe in it, breathe it in and make it yours. This won’t happen if you feel guilty or dirty or sinful. If you don’t believe in the resume/application then no one else will. If you feel guilty it will show on your face and it will be in the sound of your voice. Remember to look them in the eyes and state it as you rehearsed. Rehearse like any good actor does, rehearse, rehearse, and rehearse.   
- If you don’t get caught and you work there for years it may linger at the back of your mind, am I going to get caught? It all boils down to these three emotions: feeling bad, becoming unemployed, worrying. Well isn’t that the situation you are in now?

Fact: If you are currently unemployed your chances for finding a job in the first five weeks of unemployment are three times higher than for someone out of work for longer than five weeks.   
   
Fact: If you are currently unemployed and up against another candidate who is employed you have less than a 50% chance of getting the job especially if you’ve been unemployed long term.   
   
Fact: There are many organizations who tell their HR staff not to hire the unemployed.   
   
Fact: Many employers have minimum qualifications and if you do not meet these qualifications your resume/application will not even be reviewed. A sample of these qualifications include: Have you had at least three years of employment at your last two jobs? Do you have at least 5 years of experience in the position you are applying for? Have you ever been arrested? Have you ever been terminated from a position? Answer one of these in the negative and your chances drop dramatically.   
   
Fact: Unemployment gaps not accounted for in an application or resume will disqualify you with many employers.   
   
Fact: Employers keep resumes and applications electronically.  If you sent the initial application in electronically two years ago and you apply for a current position, know that your application from the past will be compared with your new one.   
   
Fact: Make sure you have a plan and stick to it. This book is here to provide you with an outline of your plan. Follow this outline and you will get a job.   
   
Fact: When applying for a job you are competing against many other fake resumes designed specifically for that position. What chances do you have if you don’t know how to design your resume?       
   
Fact: This is an employer’s market and they can keep fishing until they get themselves what they deem to be the perfect catch. This is why it is important that you present yourself as the biggest fish in the sea. Your resume is your bait.

What Are They Looking For?   
   
     
They want longevity of 3+ years or longer for each job you’ve held for a majority of your work history. Employment gaps must be explained. They want you to have current employment, experience in their market, and have no terminations on your record. They don’t want you to be over qualified, or under qualified. They want you living at the location of the job, or you must state you want to move to that location. You must have all of the qualifications stated for the job position. They prefer to have a personal reference from someone they know and trust.
