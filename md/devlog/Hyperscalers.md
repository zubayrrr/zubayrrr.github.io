A hyperscaler is a company that provides cloud computing services on a massive scale. These companies, which include the likes of Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud, have built vast data centers and networks of servers that allow them to offer a wide range of cloud services, such as storage, computing, and databases, to businesses and individuals around the world. Hyperscalers are known for their ability to scale their services up or down quickly and efficiently in response to changing demand, making them an attractive option for organizations that need to quickly and easily access large amounts of computing power.   
   
Cloud providers are companies that offer cloud computing services, such as storage, computing, and databases, to businesses and individuals. Hyperscalers are a type of cloud provider that offer these services on a massive scale, with the ability to quickly and efficiently scale up or down in response to changing demand. In other words, all hyperscalers are cloud providers, but not all cloud providers are hyperscalers.
