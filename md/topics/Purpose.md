## Sloww Hierarchy of Happiness – Purpose   
   
**Happiness is a byproduct of finding meaning and purpose**   
   
> I’ve learned that there is nothing more consistent with unhappiness than spending your time in a way that doesn’t serve who you are ... there is no more profound source of fulfillment and happiness than knowing you are traveling your own path... — Scott Dinsmore   
   
> ‘Years of research on the psychology of well-being have demonstrated that often human beings are happiest when they are engaged in meaningful pursuits and virtuous activities.’ Indeed, when we are deeply engaged in an activity that is in accordance with our best self, we often report the highest levels of life satisfaction. — Scientific American   
   
> Very few follow the path laid out for them—the path to their Personal Legends, and to happiness. — Paulo Coelho   
   
> Happiness cannot be pursued; it must ensue. One must have a reason to ‘be happy.’ Once the reason is found, however, one becomes happy automatically. As we see, a human being is not one in pursuit of happiness but rather in search of a reason to become happy, last but not least, through actualizing the potential meaning inherent and dormant in a given situation.— [Viktor Frankl](/not_created.md), Man’s Search for Meaning   
   
> Pleasure is, and must remain, a side-effect or by-product, and is destroyed and spoiled to the degree to which it is made a goal in itself. — [Viktor Frankl](/not_created.md)   
   
> Once an individual’s search for a meaning is successful, it not only renders him happy but also gives him the capability to cope with suffering. — [Viktor Frankl](/not_created.md)   
   
> The difference between happiness and fulfillment is the difference between liking something and loving something ... Happiness comes from what we do. Fulfillment comes from why we do it. — [Simon Sinek](/not_created.md)   
   
Instead of making happiness the goal, focus on meaning and purpose.   
   
> Many persons have a wrong idea of what constitutes true happiness. It is not attained through self-gratification but through fidelity to a worthy purpose. — Helen Keller   
   
> Our deepest happiness in life stems from fulfilling purpose. Doing the best we can, where we are, with what we’ve been given is the best way to live a life of meaning and significance. — Joshua Becker
