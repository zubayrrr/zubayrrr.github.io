"O Fortuna" is a medieval Latin poem that has been set to music by several composers, most famously by the German composer Carl Orff in his cantata "Carmina Burana." The poem is a hymn to Fortuna, the Roman goddess of fortune, and describes the fickle and unpredictable nature of fortune. The line "o fortuna velut luna" translates to "O Fortune, like the moon." In Orff's setting of the poem, "O Fortuna" is the opening and closing movement of the cantata, and has become one of the most recognizable and frequently performed pieces of classical music.   
   
> _Quod sua mihi munera, subtrahit rebellis / Verum est quod legitur, fronte capillata / Sed plerumque sequitur, occasio calvata:_   
   
_The gifts she gives to me, she snatches away / Truly it is said, Fortuna has a full head of hair / But when your opportunity is there!—she is bald_   
   
> _Fortune rota volvitur, descendo minoratus / Alter in altem tollitur, nimis exaltatus:_   
   
_The wheel of fortune turns; I descend, having been brought down / Another is raised up; he is exalted—too much!_
