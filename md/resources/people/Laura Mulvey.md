Laura Mulvey is a British feminist film theorist.   
   
Cinema, according to Mulvey, affords two forms of pleasure: scopophilia, the erotic, voyeuristic pleasure of subjecting others to a controlling and curious gaze and which is associated with the libido; and the narcissistic pleasure of identification with the male protagonist (or the cameraâ€™s point of view)
