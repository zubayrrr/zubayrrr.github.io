## The    
   
We use the indefinite articles A and An when we talk about a non-specific thing or person **for the first time**. When we talk about the same thing or person again it becomes non-specific; it has become a particular thing or person.   
   
We use the article **The** when talking about a specific or a particular thing or person,   
   
Example:   
   
   
- I found a cat under my car in the morning. (talking about the non-specific cat for the first time)   
-  Did you feed **the** cat before you left? (talking about the same cat for the second time)   
   
## One   
   
We use one as a pronoun in order to avoid using the same noun several times.   
   
We only use **one** when we donâ€™t talk about a particular object.   
   
Example:   
   
   
- Mary and John both have cars. Mary has a red **one**, John has a black **one**.   
- I went down to the store to buy a new iPhone and I bought the last **one**.   
   
## It   
   
It is a pronoun, we can use it instead of a singular specific object.   
   
Example:   
   
   
- Honey, did you see my car key?   
	- Yes, I think I saw it before the dog ate it.
