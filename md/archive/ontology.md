[Ontology (information science) - Wikipedia](<[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_(information_science)>)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_(information_science)>))   
   
> In computer science and information science, an ontology encompasses a representation, formal naming, and definition of the categories, properties, and relations between the concepts, data, and entities that substantiate one, many, or all domains of discourse. More simply, an ontology is a way of showing the properties of a subject area and how they are related, by defining a set of concepts and categories that represent the subject.

> Tags are doors and links are corridors. Tags are how you enter a building, and links are how you navigate around once you're in. So you'll in general have few tags and not every note will have a tag. But you'll want many links. — via [How to Use Tags](https://karl-voit.at/2022/01/29/How-to-Use-Tags/)   
   
At a high level, this note defines the tags/categories of notes.   
   
A tag defines the category of note at its most fundamental level, a tag can be used to define subcategories; such as:   
   
Let’s say we’ve a note [Machine Learning](../topics/machine%20learning.md) tagged with \#topics and we have a note [Machine learning algorithms](../devlog/machine%20learning%20algorithms.md), this note will not be tagged \#CS or \#Machine-Learning or \#topics, it'll instead be backlinked to [Machine Learning](../topics/machine%20learning.md) under `Topics:`   
   
I was pretty much lost, unable to find a way to properly use tags, until the timely discovery of this article: [How to Use Tags](https://karl-voit.at/2022/01/29/How-to-Use-Tags/)   
   
I am gonna stick to Karl Voit's Tagging Rules:   
   
1. Use as few tags as possible.   
2. Limit yourself to a self-defined set of tags.   
3. Tags within your set must not overlap.   
4. By convention, tags are in plural.   
5. Tags are lower-case.   
6. Tags are single words.   
7. Keep tags on a general level.   
8. Omit tags that are obvious.   
   
## The thing about tags.   
   
> Tags are an easy way to relate heterogeneous items, but they’re quite a low-signal way of describing relationships.   
   
> All items with a given tag are presented as being related… but it’s hard to see how. They’re just a jumbled, unordered list.   
   
> Some of those items are more relevant to a particular tag’s topic than others, so we should [Prefer explicit associations to inferred associations](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4RjXweCWNTdmHUFJpDCPmWVnwBEDbKviu9QJ).   
   
> And sometimes, it would be very helpful to have a few words of context about _why_ an item relates to a particular tag. We should [Prefer labeled associations](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z7pGUpz2fQsHHUPbjThz85xXPvHwrmikAeYH4).

## Ontology of Tags   
   
   
- \#quotes - quotes from people   
- \#books - books   
- \#tidbits - tidbits of code snippets, information   
   
so on...   
   
## Ontology of Backlinks
