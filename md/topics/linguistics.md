Linguistic agnosticism refers to the idea that it is not possible to know for certain whether or not a particular language or system of communication is "better" or "more correct" than another. This concept is based on the belief that all languages and systems of communication are equally valid and have their own unique strengths and limitations.   
   
Linguistic agnosticism can be contrasted with linguistic absolutism, which is the belief that some languages or systems of communication are inherently superior to others. This perspective can lead to language elitism, the idea that certain languages or dialects are more prestigious or desirable than others.   
   
Linguistic agnosticism is often associated with linguistic relativity, the idea that the structure of a particular language can shape and influence a speaker's thoughts and perceptions. This theory suggests that different languages may have different ways of organizing and expressing ideas, which can lead to differences in the way that speakers of those languages view the world.

Linguistic determinism is the concept that language and its structures influence and limit human knowledge or thought, as well as thought processes such as categorization, memory, and perception. The term implies that people's native languages will affect their thought process and therefore people will have different thought processes based on their mother tongues.   
   
Linguistic determinism is the strong form of linguistic relativity (popularly known as the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis), which argues that individuals experience the world based on the structure of the language they habitually use.
