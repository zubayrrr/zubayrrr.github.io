> Simply put, decision theory is an analysis of decision-making process. It seeks to evaluate how choices are made. Decision theory is a logical study of how decisions are made in a structure or system where the decision environment is uncertain and the decision variables unknown. Decision theory draws tools from mathematics, philosophy, statistics and psychology in analysing how decisions are made. This theory also has to do with how choices are logically made based on probabilities and uncertain consequences. â€” via [Decision Theory - Explained - The Business Professor, LLC](https://thebusinessprofessor.com/en_US/research-analysis-decision-science/decision-theory-definition)
