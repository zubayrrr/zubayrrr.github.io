In Buddhism, dhyana (also spelled "jhana" or "dhyan" in Sanskrit, "zen" in Japanese, and "chán" in Chinese) refers to a state of deep concentration or meditative absorption. It is a central practice in many schools of Buddhism, and is considered to be the fifth of the Eightfold Path, which is a set of practices leading to the end of suffering (dukkha) and the attainment of enlightenment.   
   
In dhyana, the mind becomes still and focused on a single object or concept, such as the breath or a mantra. This allows the practitioner to let go of distractions and achieve a state of inner peace and clarity. Dhyana is often accompanied by feelings of joy and equanimity, and can lead to insights and realization about the nature of reality.   
   
While dhyana is often associated with seated meditation, it can also be practiced in daily activities such as walking, eating, and working. The ultimate goal of dhyana is to cultivate mindfulness and a sense of present-moment awareness, which can lead to a deep understanding of the nature of reality and the end of suffering.
