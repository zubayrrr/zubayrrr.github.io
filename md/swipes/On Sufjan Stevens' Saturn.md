## Page Notes   
## Highlights   
   
- "The subject of the album is not just the wilderness of outer space, but the interior space of human consciousness and how it engages with divinity, depravity, society and self—what does it mean to be human? This existential question rings clear from the opening lyric: “What’s right and what’s wrong?” The 75 minutes of music that follow provide a complex thesis: to be human is to be a total mess. The result of this creative alliance is a musical and aesthetic journey as far-reaching as its subject: from lush piano ballads to prog-rock political anthems, curious electronic back-beats to classical cadenzas, the vast musical styles seek to explore the diversity and mystery of our cosmos."- 4AD — [Updated on 2021-07-25 08:30:29](https://hyp.is/GQY_bu1EEeuBmhtR8GoNoA/www.youtube.com/) — Group: `{_obsidian_pattern_tag_hypothesis}`
