> By [John Keats](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/john-keats)    
>    
> This living hand, now warm and capable   
> Of earnest grasping, would, if it were cold     
> And in the icy silence of the tomb,    
> So haunt thy days and chill thy dreaming nights     
> That thou would wish thine own heart dry of blood   
> So in my veins red life might stream again,     
> And thou be conscience-calm’d–see here it is–   
> I hold it towards you.
