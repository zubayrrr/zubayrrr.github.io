[I highly encourage people to explore meditation geared towards focus and refocus, also NSDR, non-sleep deep rest, AKA yoga nidra, and the Reverie app specifically the hypnosis within the Reverie app that's geared towards improving focus and concentration. All of these have terrific science to support them.](https://huberman.rile.yt/?query=meditation)
