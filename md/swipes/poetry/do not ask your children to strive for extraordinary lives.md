> “Do not ask your children   
> to strive for extraordinary lives.   
> Such striving may seem admirable,   
> but it is the way of foolishness.   
> Help them instead to find the wonder   
> and the marvel of an ordinary life.   
> Show them the joy of tasting   
> tomatoes, apples and pears.   
> Show them how to cry   
> when pets and people die.   
> Show them the infinite pleasure   
> in the touch of a hand.   
> And make the ordinary come alive for them.   
> The extraordinary will take care of itself.”   
   
> William Martin
