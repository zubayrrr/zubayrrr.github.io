- A single cable can have a different connector on either end.   
- When one of the cable end doesn't match our needs, we'll need an Adapter, such as serial [RS-232](/not_created.md) to USB.   
- Crimping tools can be used to attach cable wires to connectors for custom-built cables, example: using a crimper to attach [RJ-45](../devlog/rj-45.md) network connectors to unshielded pair copper cables.   
   
#### Connectors in Fiber Optic   
   
   
- Straight Tip (ST)   
- Lucent Connector (LC), often used to setup audio, such as connecting a television to a soundbar that uses optical technology.   
   
#### BNC   
   
   
- Used with [coax cable](../devlog/coax.md)   
- Cable types such as RG-6, 58, 59   
   
#### Registered Jack (RJ)   
   
   
- Used with [UTP](../devlog/utp.md) and [STP](../devlog/stp.md) - [Twisted Pair](../devlog/twisted%20pair.md) cables   
- [RJ-11](../devlog/rj-11.md)   
- [RJ-45](../devlog/rj-45.md)   
   
#### Other   
   
   
- [VGA](../devlog/vga.md)   
- [DB-9](../devlog/db-9.md)   
- [Molex](../devlog/molex.md)   
- [SCSI](/not_created.md)   
- [eSATA](/not_created.md)

## Connector Adapters   
   
Connector adapters are used to convert from one connector type to another such as:   
   
   
- DVI —> HDMI   
- DVI —> VGA   
- USB —> Ethernet   
- USB —> Serial   
- Molex —> SATA
