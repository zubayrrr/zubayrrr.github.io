Also known as Hape, Rapeh, Hapé, Rapé is a very fine, dry, and usually greenish powder. The shamans from South America have been using it for centuries as a medicine. Its main ingredient is a special kind of tobacco.   
   
Rapé has been traditionally produced in South America. But the growing demand for this powder has extended the production to other places.   
   
The indigenous people who prepare rapé included Katukina, Kaxinawa and Nu-nu tribes.   
   
The main ingredient of rapé (aka Hapé, Rapeh) is a special blend of tobacco called nicotiana rustica, which contains up to 20 times the amount of nicotine usually found in the common tobacco.   
   
The indigenous tribes from South America usually make their rapé with a very strong tobacco called nicotiana rustica (also known as mapacho), and they mix it with various medicinal plants, such as mint, clover, tonka beans, banana peels, and cinnamon. To produce the ash they burn the bark of local trees.   
   
Goa Rapé is produced with the same process, but with different ingredients. The ask is obtained by burning the cork of Banyan tree, which is the most sacred tree of India. The tobacco is a special blend of nicotiana grown in Afghanistan. The herbs are selected among the most beneficial Ayurvedic medicines.   
   
Some rapé recipes also include more powerful ingredients such as anadenanthera, jurema, and coca. One day I have also, on one occasion tried a blend of snuff with a tiny percentage of datura, which is a very powerful psychotropic plant.   
   
Amazon people administer it to each other using a pipe called Tepi. They insert a certain amount of shamanic snuff into the pipe, apply the pipe to the nostril of the other person and blow the rapé into his or her nose.   
   
An alternative way to take the shamanic snuff is by using the Kuripe, a small, v-shaped pipe that allows one to self-administer the mixture.
