- EC2 stands for Elastic Compute Cloud.   
- It is a virtual server in AWS Cloud.   
- Its an AWS service that allows you to rent virtual computers to use, which are called EC2 instances.   
- There are many types of EC2 which all have different amounts of CPU, memory, storage types, and speeds.   
- There are instances that are compute optimized when you need high-performance processes, there are memory optimized when you need lots of RAM, there are also storage optimized instances and many more.   
- There are different ways in which you can pay for these instances, such as:   
  - On-demand, where you by the hour or seconds, depending on the type of instance you're using with no long-term commitments.   
- The world Elastic in the name refers to ability to resize, you can start by choosing a very low specification for the instance and if you need more RAM or CPU power, you can turn the machine off, select a new instance type and turn it back on and the instance will immediately resume with the new specs that you choose.

1. Why is AWS more economical than traditional data centers for applications with varying compute workloads?   
   
Amazon EC2 instances can be launched on-demand when needed. The ability to launch instances on-demand when needed allows users to launch and terminate instances in response to a varying workload. This is a more economical practice than purchasing enough on-premises servers to handle the peak load.
