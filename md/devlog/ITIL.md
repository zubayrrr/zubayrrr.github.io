ITIL is a framework of best practices for delivering IT services. ITIL’s systematic approach to [ITSM](../devlog/ITSM.md) can help businesses manage risk, strengthen customer relations, and build an IT environment geared for growth, scale, and change.   
   
ITIL has gone through several revisions in its history and currently comprises five books, each covering various processes and stages of the IT service lifecycle. The books contain recommendations and a framework that can help organizations standardize their service management processes. ITIL promises to reduce IT operations cost, improve productivity and employee satisfaction, and manage risk, failure, and disruption throughout the organization.   
   
The goal of ITIL is for organizations to create predictable IT environments and to deliver the best customer service possible to customers and clients by streamlining processes and identifying opportunities to improve efficiency. ITIL has always focused on integrating IT into the business — something that has become increasingly important as technology becomes a vital aspect of every business unit. ITIL 4, the latest iteration of the ITIL framework, maintains the original focus with a stronger emphasis on fostering an agile and flexible IT department.   
   
## What are the ITIL 4 guiding principles?   
   
ITIL 4 contains seven guiding principles that were adopted from the most recent ITIL Practitioner Exam, which covers organizational change management, communication, and measurement and metrics. These principles include:   
   
   
- Focus on value   
- Start where you are   
- Progress iteratively with feedback   
- Collaborate and promote visibility   
- Think and work holistically   
- Keep it simple and practical   
- Optimize and automate   
   
ITIL 4 focuses on company culture and integrating IT into the overall business structure. It encourages collaboration between IT and other departments, especially as other business units increasingly rely on technology to get work done. There is also a strong emphasis on customer feedback given that it’s easier than ever for businesses to understand their public perception, as well as customer satisfaction and dissatisfaction.
