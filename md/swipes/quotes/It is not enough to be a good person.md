"It is not enough to be a good person. You must also be competent enough to be able to defend yourself and others against evil. To do this, you must understand the nature of evil and be capable of acting in the face of it. But you must also be capable of resisting the temptation to do evil yourself, even when you have the power to do so. To be truly good, you must be both capable and unwilling to act evilly." â€” [Jordan Peterson](/not_created.md)
