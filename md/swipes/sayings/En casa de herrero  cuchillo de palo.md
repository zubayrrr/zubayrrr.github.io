> Have you ever heard the old Spanish proverb, “En casa de herrero, cuchillo de palo” (The Blacksmith’s Home has Wooden Knives) Or perhaps, more common-The Cobbler’s Kid’s Have No Shoes. Other culture’s have equal sayings- In Chinese “the lady who sells fans fans herself with her hands”, in Arabic, “at the potter’s house water is served in a broken jug”. Regardless, it means that in business, very often we take better care of our customers than ourselves. — via [The Blacksmith's Home Has Wooden Knives - Paperboat Media](https://paperboatmedia.com/the-blacksmiths-home-has-wooden-knives/)
