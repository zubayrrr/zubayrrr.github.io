Loss of autonomy refers to a reduction or loss of the ability to make independent decisions or to control one's own actions. This can be due to various factors such as physical or mental impairments, external pressures or constraints, or loss of power or authority. The experience of loss of autonomy can be distressing and can have a negative impact on an individual's well-being and quality of life. It is important to recognize and respect an individual's autonomy and to provide support and assistance as needed to help them maintain or regain control over their lives.
