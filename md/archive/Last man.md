> The **Last man** (German: Letzter Mensch) is a term used by the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche in Thus Spoke Zarathustra to describe the antithesis of his theorized superior being, the Ãœbermensch, whose imminent appearance is heralded by Zarathustra. The last man is the archetypal passive nihilist.  He is tired of life, takes no risks, and seeks only comfort and security.  Therefore, The Last Man is unable to build and act upon a self-actualized ethos.
