The Ban Huan Thai Psilocybe Cubensis was also brought back by John Allen and –Clyde- by a sponsored trip to thailand. The Ban Huan mushrooms are very popular in Thailand and a normal part of their culture.   
   
The original strain off the Psilocybe Cubensis Ban Huan Thai produced various results and had a rather “wild” grow.

Characteristics of the Thai Ban Huan magic mushrooms   
   
   
- Cultivation difficulty: Easy   
- Potency: Moderate to potent   
- Fruiting time: 14 - 21 days   
- Fruiting temperature: 23 – 26 Celsius   
   
As far as potency goes, we would say the Thai magic mushrooms is up there with the Penis Envy as one of the most potent cubensis.   
   
The most common environment where the Thai mushroom grows is rice paddies where water buffalo's work the fields.   
   
We can say that the original Thai mushroom is a dung fungi as they grow feeding on water buffalo dung nutrients.   
   
Local Thai people, particularly native cattle owners, harvest the fungi when the water buffalo is moved from the rice paddies to the mountainous terrain at the start of the rice production season in late fall and early spring.
