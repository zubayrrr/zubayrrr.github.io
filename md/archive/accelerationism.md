**Accelerationism** is a range of ideas in critical and social theory that propose that social processes, such as capitalist growth and technological change, should be drastically intensified to create further radical social change referred to as "acceleration".   
   
The term can also refer to the post-Marxist idea that because of capitalism's internal contradictions and instabilities, the abolition of the capitalist system and its class structures could be brought about by its acceleration. Various ideas, including French critical theorists Gilles Deleuze and FÃ©lix Guattari's idea of deterritorialization, as well as aspects of the theoretical systems and processes developed by English philosopher Nick Land, are crucial influences on accelerationism, which aims to analyze and subsequently promote the social, economic, cultural, and libidinal forces that constitute the process of acceleration.Contemporary accelerationism has since been ideologically divided into mutually contradictory left-wing and right-wing variants. Both support the indefinite intensification of capitalism and its structures as well as the growth of a potential technological singularity, a hypothetical point in time where technological growth becomes uncontrollable and irreversible. The term has also been appropriated and placed into contexts distanced from traditional accelerationist ideas. Right-wing extremists such as Neo-fascists, Neo-Nazis, White nationalists, and White supremacists have been known to refer to an "acceleration" of racial conflict through violent means such as assassinations, murders, terrorist attacks, and societal collapse, in order to achieve the building of a White ethnostate.
