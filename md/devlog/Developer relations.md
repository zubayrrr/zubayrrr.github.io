Developer Relations, also known as DevRel, is an umbrella term covering the strategies and tactics for building and nurturing a community of mutually beneficial relationships between organizations and developers (e.g., software developers) as the primary users, and often influencers on purchases, of a product.   
   
Developer Relations is a form of Platform Evangelism and the activities involved are sometimes referred to as a Developer Program or DevRel Program. A DevRel program may comprise a framework built around some or all of the following aspects:   
   
* Developer Marketing: Outreach and engagement activities to create awareness and convert developers to use a product.   
* Developer Education: Product documentation and education resources to aid learning and build affinity with a product and community.   
* Developer Experience (DX): Resources like a developer portal, product, and documentation, to activate the developer with the least friction.   
* Developer Success: Activities to nurture and retain developers as they build and scale with a product.   
* Community: Nourishes a community to maintain a sustainable program.   
   
The impacts and goals of DevRel programs include:   
   
* Increased revenue and funding   
* User growth and retention   
* product innovation and improvements   
* Customer satisfaction and support deflection   
* Strong technical recruiting pipeline   
* Brand recognition and awareness   
   
Other goals of DevRel initiatives can include:   
   
* Product Building: An organization relies on a community of developers to build their technology (e.g., open source).   
* Product-market Fit: The product's success depends on understanding developers' needs and desires.   
* Developer Enablement: Supporting developers' use of the product (e.g., by providing education, tools, and infrastructure).   
* Developer Perception: To overcome developer perceptions that may be preventing success of a product.   
* Hiring/Recruiting: To attract potential developers for recruitment.
