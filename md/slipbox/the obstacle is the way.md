- Many great people who achieved many great things understood the fact that in order to change themselves they had to change their minds.   
- To believe is to become. The obstacle is the way.   
- Often, our most intense discomfort is what leads or necessitates us into thinking in a way we've never done before. The problem leads to the solution.   
- We have always been forced to learn something new, develop deeper awareness of things in order to survive. We developed agriculture, society, medicine etc to have better chances of survival as a species.   
- The elements of our world were once just solutions to fears.   
- Learn to consciously regard the "problems" in your life as openings for you become better, understand better and deeper about life and develop a better way of living it.   
- In the process you'll step out of the labryinth of suffering and chaos, and learn what it means to thrive.   
- Learning how to think is the gateway to learning all the other things that are important for us such as loving, coexisting, giving etc.   
- The most important duty as thinking and conscious beings is to actualize the potential we were born with - both for us and for the world.
