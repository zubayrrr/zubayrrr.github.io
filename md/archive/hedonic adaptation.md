> Hedonic adaptation is the tendency of us mere humans to quickly return to a relatively stable level of happiness despite major recent positive or negative events or life changes. According to this theory, as we make more money (or eat more choccy), our expectations and desires rise in tandem. This then results in no permanent gain in happiness.—via [Hedonic Adaptation - Restricting pleasure increases pleasure](https://www.coglode.com/research/hedonic-adaptation)
