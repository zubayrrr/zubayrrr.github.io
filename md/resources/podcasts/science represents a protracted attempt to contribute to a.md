Science represents a protracted attempt to contribute to a public edifice of knowledge founded on probabilistic evidence that the piecemeal construction achieves some important similarities with reality. No one sincerely believes that his or her single experiment will answer any useful question once and for all. . . .   
. . . theory development (knowledge) integrated across many single investigators (and experiments and data analyses) represents the true value of science to society.
