a man misses something by not establishing a participative and living relationship with the non-human world of animals and plants, landscapes and stars and seasons. By failing to be, vicariously, the not-self, he fails to be completely himself. â€” [aldous huxley](../../resources/people/aldous%20huxley.md)
