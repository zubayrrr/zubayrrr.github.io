## Notes   
   
[No Free Will: The Biology of Behavior with Robert Sapolsky](https://www.sloww.co/free-will-robert-sapolsky/)   
   
To quote [robert sapolsky](../resources/people/robert%20sapolsky.md)   
   
> “Not only am I a free will skeptic, I don’t believe there is a shred of agency that goes into any of our behavior.”   
> “What we call ‘free will’ is simply the biology that we haven’t understood well enough yet.”   
> “If there is free will, it’s in all the boring places, and those places are getting more and more cramped.”   
> “I am extremely out in left field with this along with people like [sam harris](../resources/people/sam%20harris.md) and a few other philosophers in terms of absolutely hard [determinism](../archive/determinism.md) and hard [incompatibilism](../archive/incompatibilism.md).”
