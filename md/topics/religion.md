## Quotes

2.  "To be an atheist is to hold that the universe is a natural, not a supernatural, phenomenon and that our existence can be explained without reference to a divine being." - Bertrand Russell   
3.  "Atheism is not a philosophy; it is not even a view of the world; it is simply an admission of the obvious." - Sam Harris

5.  "The fact that a believer is happier than a skeptic is no more to the point than the fact that a drunken man is happier than a sober one." - George Bernard Shaw   
6.  "Atheism is not a denial of gods; it is a denial of the idea of god." - Stephen Roberts

12.  "I cannot believe in a God who wants to be praised all the time." - Friedrich Nietzsche    
13.  "Atheism is a term that should not even exist. No one ever needs to identify himself as a 'non-astrologer' or a 'non-alchemist.'

14.  "The idea of a personal God is quite alien to me and seems even naive." - Albert Einstein
