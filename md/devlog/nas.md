Network Attached Storage uses standard file-sharing protocols, like CIFS for the [Windows](../devlog/windows.md) platform, or NFS for the [UNIX](/not_created.md) and [linux](../topics/linux.md) platforms for connecting to shared folders without having a server, because the [NAS](../devlog/nas.md) has firmware to act as a server to serve the content.   
   
   
- Network storage accessible over standard [tcp‚ÅÑip model](../devlog/tcp%E2%81%84ip%20model.md) network   
- File and folder sync to NAS device   
- Backup of NAS data to the cloud   
- Accessed via file sharing/streaming protocols ([NFS](../devlog/NFS.md), [SMB](../devlog/smb.md), [UPnP](/not_created.md))
