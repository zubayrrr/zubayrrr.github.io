- Central Processing Unit; is the "brain" of the computer   
- It does all the computation   
- We can have Multi-core CPUs; Multiple CPUs within a single physical chip   
- CPU speed is measured in Gigahertz(Ghz)   
- Common CPU manufacturers include: AMD, Intel   
   
#### CPU characteristics and options   
   
   
- L1, L2, L3 cache - they're high-speed memory used to cache recently used processing intructions. L1 is considered to be fastest. More cache memory is better but they come in small quantity as they're expensive.   
- 32-bit vs 64-bit (modern)   
- Virtualization extensions(function of BIOS)   
- Overclocking is an option to run the CPU at a faster speed than it's been safely tested at   
- A integrated GPU - graphics processing capabilities as part of the CPU, which would negate the need of a separate video card(they're usually not very high-end though)   
- When Hyper-threading is enabled, the OS will assume the computer as 2 logical CPUs even though we only have 1 physical CPU   
- Liquid cooling systems   
- Fan with heat sink to draw heat away from the board   
- Thermal paste to withstand heat but keeps heat sink and other components together
