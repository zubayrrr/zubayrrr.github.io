A John Doe order is a type of pre-infringement injunction used to safeguard the creator's intellectual property rights in artistic works such as movies and songs. The Rolling Anton Pillar, Anton Pillar, or Ashok Kumar order is another name for the John Doe order.   
   
The John Doe order is based on several instances in which a court must issue such orders even before an infringement occurs. It is done in the form of a Quia Timet injunction to preserve the plaintiff's rights and to prevent threatening or imminent unjust acts by an unknown defendant. â€” via [John Doe Order](https://www.legalserviceindia.com/legal/article-7158-john-doe-order.html)
