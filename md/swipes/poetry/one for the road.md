> There's amnesia in a hangknot,   
> And comfort in the ax,   
> But the simple way of poison will make your nerves relax.   
>         There's surcease in a gunshot,   
>         And sleep that comes from racks,   
>         But a handy draft of poison avoids the harshest tax.   
> You find rest on the hot squat,   
> Or gas can give you pax,   
> But the closest corner chemist has peace in packaged stacks.   
>         There's refuge in the church lot   
>         When you tire of facing facts,   
>         And the smoothest route is poison prescribed by kindly quacks.   
> Chorus: With an *ugh!* and a groan, and a kick of the heels,   
>         Death comes quiet, or it comes with squeals --   
>         But the pleasantest place to find your end   
>         Is a cup of cheer from the hand of a friend.   
>                 -- Jubal Harshaw, "One For The Road"
