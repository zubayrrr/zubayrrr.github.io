Minikube is a tool that lets you run Kubernetes locally. Minikube runs a single-node Kubernetes cluster on your personal computer so that you can try out Kubernetes, or for daily development work.   
   
It is a one node cluster, master and worker process run on one node. It comes with [Docker](../devlog/docker.md) preinstalled. It runs via VM or a hypervisor.
