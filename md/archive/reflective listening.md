The phrase "and how did that make you feel" is often associated with therapists because it is a common technique used by therapists in [psychotherapy](../topics/psychotherapy.md) and counselling sessions. This technique, known as reflective listening, involves repeating back to the client what they have just said, and asking them how it made them feel.   
   
Reflective listening is used by therapists to help clients to explore their feelings and emotions, and to gain a deeper understanding of their thoughts and experiences. By repeating back to the client what they have said, and asking them how it made them feel, the therapist is able to show the client that they are listening and understanding, and to encourage the client to reflect on their feelings and emotions.
