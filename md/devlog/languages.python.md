## Handling Errors   
   
   
- Write code that handles errors; catch, print, handle the errors as they happen.   
- Errors not handled correctly can lead to data loss, downtime etc.   
- Consider critical and non-critical infrastructure/data/operations.   
   
## Exception    
   
   
- Exception is a Python object that represents an error.   
- When a python script encounters a situation that it cannot cope with, it raises or throws an exception, in which case:   
- Use `try`/`except` blocks.   
   
## Environment Variables   
   
   
- You can use `os` module to fetch environment variables set in your `~/.bash_profile`   
- You can also add them to your IntelliJ, PyCharm project configuration.
