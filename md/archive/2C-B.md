2C-B stands for 2,5-dimethoxy-4-bromophenethylamine, a synthetic drug with psychedelic effects. 2C-B is a phenylethylamine derivative and has a similar structure to mescaline, another psychedelic drug. It is described as a psychedelic drug with visual effects and some stimulant-like properties. Anecdotal reports draw similarities between LSD and MDMA.   
   
2C-B was first synthesised by Alexander Shulgin in 1974 and his findings were reported in his 1991 book entitled PiHKAL. Following its discovery, there was some reported use of 2C-B by psychotherapists in the 1970s, which was followed by a breakthrough of use into the recreational drug scene in the 70s and 80s. 2C-B had a short-lived legitimate history and was marketed as an aphrodisiac in smart shops in America and the Netherlands, before being classified as illegal in several countries, including the UK, in the 90s.   
   
Currently, 2C-B (and other 2C drugs such as 2C-D, 2C-E, 2C-I, 2C-P) are Class A, Schedule 1 drugs in the UK. This means they are illegal to possess, supply and produce. In recent years, 2C-B has increased in popularity in sales over the darknet, and is popular in the rave and festival scene. â€” via [What is 2C-B and what are the effects, dosage, and risks? - Drug Science](https://www.drugscience.org.uk/drug-information/2cb/)
