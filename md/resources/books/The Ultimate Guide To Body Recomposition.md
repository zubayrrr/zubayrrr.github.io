“Pay attention to how you start because it will not only determine how you finish, but determine your fulfillment along the way.” As we see it, one of the reasons so many people end up not finishing what they started is because hey didn’t start the right, or most optimal, way.   
   
When it comes to optimizing your approach to get to your goals, knowledge without application places you no further ahead than those who do not know.   
   
Like most facets of life, experience matters. To get to where you want to be, you first need to know where you are right now. Your starting line will most likely be different than others’, meaning the route to your end point may also differ.   
   
## Notes   
   
   
- A beginner’s body is most primed for growth when weight training is still a new stimulus. To fuel the speedy muscle building process, the body can “easily” tap into body fat stores to yield impressive recomposition.   
- Concepts like “calories-in versus calories-out,” “a carb is a carb” and “eat according to your schedule” can be powerful approximations for a beginner, but can be misleading and limiting to those with more experience.   
- body recomposition = a reduction in body fat percentage alongside an increase in lean body mass (more specifically, muscle mass).   
-    
   
Body recomposition can also be when:    
   
- YOU BUILD MUSCLE WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY LOSING FAT.   
- YOU BUILD MUSCLE MASS WHILE MAINTAINING BODY FAT MASS.   
	- Adding lean muscle mass leading to lower overall less body fat compared to when you started(as you weight more now).   
- YOU LOSE FAT WHILE MAINTAINING MUSCLE MASS.   
   
   
   
- the body weight scale can be difficult to interpret in the context of body recomposition and isn’t going to be a sufficient tool on its own for measuring and tracking progress. Still, we believe that it has an important place in the “body recomp toolkit”   
- **Mandatory Tools to use to track progress**: Body weight Scale, Measuring Tape, Camera (Progress Photos) and a Food Scale.   
- It’s important to realize that one’s weight speaks little, if anything, to the composition of the     
body.    
   
- Weight gain on the scale could mean many different things, not limited to:   
	- Pure fat gain   
	- Pure muscle gain   
	- A combination of fat gain and muscle gain   
	- A lot of muscle gain combined with a little bit of fat loss (so that bodyweight still   increases)   
   
### Weighing yourself   
   
For consistency purposes, we recommend tracking your body weight for four-seven days per week at the same time of day for consistency purposes.   
   
For the most accurate weigh ins, we suggest weighing as soon as you wake up, after using the bathroom and before drinking any water or eating any food.   
   
Using those four-seven body weight measurements, you will tabulate a weekly   
average. You will then compare that weekly average to future weekly averages to determine whether your weight is trending up or down over time.   
   
### Measuring tape   
   
Waist Circumference: A waist measurement will help indicate whether or not fat is being lost. For example, if your body weight is increasing but your waist circumference is decreasing, that is a very reliable sign that you are building muscle while losing fat and as a result, reshaping your body.   
   
To ensure consistency, when taking waist measurements, take the measurement at the belly button or at the smallest site on your waist. The most important thing is to be consistent with the measurement location over time.   
   
For all intents and purposes, a reduction in waist circumference is a very good   
indicator of fat loss.   
   
we suggest taking waist circumference measurements one to two times per month, on the same days each month.   
   
The other body part measurements can be taken once every one to three months when assessing muscular progress on specific areas or weak points.   
   
### Take progress photos   
   
So if you want to assess how your physique is progressing, you need to be looking at your physique!
