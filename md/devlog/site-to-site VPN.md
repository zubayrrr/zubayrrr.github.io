A site-to-site VPN is a type of virtual private network (VPN) that allows an organization to connect multiple networks to one another over a public network, such as the [internet](../devlog/internet.md). This type of VPN is often used to connect an organization's main office to its branch offices or other remote locations, allowing employees at those locations to access the organization's network and resources as if they were in the main office. Site-to-site VPNs are typically implemented using a combination of hardware and software, including VPN servers, encryption algorithms, and specialized VPN client software. This allows organizations to securely and reliably connect their networks together, even over long distances and through untrusted public networks.
