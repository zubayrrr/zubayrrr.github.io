**Exceptionalism** is the perception or belief that a species, country, society, institution, movement, individual, or time period is "exceptional" (i.e., unusual or extraordinary). The term carries the implication, whether or not specified, that the referent is superior in some way.Although the idea appears to have developed with respect to an era, today it is particularly applied with respect to particular nations or regions.Other uses of the term include medical and genetic exceptionalism.
