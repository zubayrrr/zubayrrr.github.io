[None of us will read every book out there in our lifetimes. The current average lifespan in the US is 79 years old. Subtract your age from 79. Then multiply that number by the average number of books you read in a year. That’s roughly how many books you have left to read in your life. But, we may not get the full 79 years. So, follow Thoreau’s advice: “Read the best books first, or you may not have a chance to read them at all.”](https://www.sloww.co/book-recommendations-reading-list/)   
   
_“Sit in a room and read—and read and read. And read the right books by the right people. Your mind is brought onto that level, and you have a nice, mild, slow-burning rapture all the time.” — Joseph Campbell_
