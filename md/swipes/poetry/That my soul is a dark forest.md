title: That my soul is a dark forest
updated: 1659952275867

This is what I believe:   
   
> “That I am I.”   
>    
> “That my soul is a dark forest.”   
>    
> “That my known self will never be more than a little clearing in the forest.”   
   
> “That gods, strange gods, come forth from the forest into the clearing of my known self, and then go back.”   
   
> “That I must have the courage to let them come and go.”   
   
> “That I will never let mankind put anything over me, but that I will try always to recognize and submit to the gods in me and the gods in other men and women.”   
   
There is my creed.
