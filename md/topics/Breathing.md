[The best way of breathing is to breathe through your nose, unless you have an obstruction or inability to do so. If that is the case, then you can breathe through your nose and mouth or just your mouth. Additionally, you can create your own breathwork practices, such as double inhaling through the nose and exhaling through the mouth, or expanding and contracting your diaphragm and expanding your stomach outward when you inhale.](https://huberman.rile.yt/?query=best+way+of+breathing)   
   
You can also try cyclic hyperventilated breathing, which is very intense inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale for 25 or 30 breaths. Additionally, you can create your own breathwork practices by understanding the components and breathing in the ways that best serve you.   
   
My advice would be to breathe through your nose while exercising, unless you're in maximum effort. Pretty soon what you'll find is you actually can create more output than you would if you were breathing through your mouth. You can also do this while walking, or while getting on the bike and starting to pedal, really starting to think about warming up the breathing system. And then you can decide if you want to do pure nasal or a combination of nasal and mouth breathing, and so on.   
   
Mouth breathing can lead to a lengthening of the face, a drooping of the eyes, and can be associated with increased risk of infections, decreased efficiency of gas exchange, and cosmetic changes. It can also be used during high intensity training, where exhaling is done through the mouth and inhaling is done through the nose.
