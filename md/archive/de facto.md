**De facto** ( day FAK-toh, dee -⁠; Latin: de facto [deː ˈfaktoː], "in fact") describes practices that exist in reality, whether or not they are officially recognized by laws or other formal norms. It is commonly used to refer to what happens in practice, in contrast with [De jure](../archive/de%20jure.md) ("by law"), which refers to things that happen according to law.
