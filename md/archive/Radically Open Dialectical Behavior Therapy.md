Radically Open Dialectical Behavior Therapy (RO-DBT) is a form of psychotherapy that is designed to help individuals who struggle with overcontrol, a pattern of excessive control or perfectionism that can lead to problems with emotional, social, and behavioral flexibility. RO-DBT was developed by Dr. Tom Lynch and is based on the principles of dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), a well-established treatment for individuals with borderline personality disorder and other conditions.   
   
RO-DBT is unique in that it focuses specifically on helping individuals to increase their openness to experience and flexibility, in order to improve their ability to adapt to new situations and to form healthy, fulfilling relationships. RO-DBT involves a combination of individual therapy, group skills training, and phone coaching, and it focuses on helping individuals to develop skills in emotion regulation, distress tolerance, and interpersonal effectiveness.
