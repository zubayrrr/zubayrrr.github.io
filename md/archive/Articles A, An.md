Articles A and An are indefinite — they’re used before a non-specific noun and non-concrete object.   
   
The difference between usage is not grammatical but phonetical. We choose to use either article based on the sound that follows it.   
   
## If the following word begins with a **consonant sound** we use the article **A**.   
   
*A musician, a computer, a chair, a university, a hockey stick*     
   
## If the following word begins with a **vowel sound** we the article **An**.   
   
*An upper cut, an orange, an honour*
