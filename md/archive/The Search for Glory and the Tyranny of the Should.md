Each person has an inherent urge to grow toward his or her potential, much in the way an acorn becomes a tree. But because we all aren’t acorns and won’t all be oaks, there is bound to be confusion about what exactly growing toward our potential means. Some twentysomethings dream too small, not understanding that their twentysomething choices matter and are, in fact, shaping the years ahead. Others dream too big, fueled more by fantasies about limitless possibilities than by experience. Part of realizing our potential is recognizing how our particular gifts and limitations fit with the world around us. We realize where our authentic potential actually lies.   
   
Working toward our potential becomes what developmental theorist Karen Horney called a search for glory when, somehow, we learn more about what is ideal than about what is real. Maybe we feel the cultural press to be an engineer before we find out what exactly that entails. Or our parents tell us more about what we should be like than what we are like. Or Facebook suggests that our twentysomething lives ought to look a lot better than they do. Scrambling after ideals, we become alienated from what is true about ourselves and the world.   
   
Sometimes my clients are unclear about whether they are striving toward their potential or are on a search for glory, but a search for glory is pretty easy to spot. Any search for glory is propelled by what Horney called the tyranny of the should.   
   
Shoulds can masquerade as high standards or lofty goals, but they are not the same. Goals direct us from the inside, but shoulds are paralyzing judgments from the outside. Goals feel like authentic dreams while shoulds feel like oppressive obligations. Shoulds set up a false dichotomy between either meeting an ideal or being a failure, between perfection or settling. The tyranny of the should even pits us against our own best interests.

[“The Tyranny of the Shoulds” is a phrase psychoanalyst Karen Horney coined in the 1950s. She believed we split ourselves between our idealised self and our real self. We bounce between what we are and what we believe we “should be.” We’re forever beating ourselves up when we remember our failings, weaknesses and foibles, bumping into the same “shoulds,” like a fish in a bowl with a short memory. It’s an eternal battle for perfection.](https://www.theroompsy.com/the-green-space-well-being/the-tyranny-of-the-shoulds)   
   
Stress is often a result of the tension between what is and what you believe should be. It's called the “tyranny of the shoulds,” and it dictates the way we think, act, and feel. These “should” beliefs—referred to as Icebergs… Stress is often a result of the tension between what is and what you believe should be.
