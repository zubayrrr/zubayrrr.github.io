Deployment models refer to the different ways in which cloud services can be deployed and accessed. The three main deployment models are public, private, and hybrid.   
   
**Public deployment models** provide users with access to cloud services over the public internet. These services are typically hosted by a third-party provider, and are available to any user who has an internet connection. Public deployment models are often used for services that require high availability and scalability, such as web applications and data storage.   
   
**Private deployment models** provide users with access to cloud services over a private network. These services are typically hosted on the user's own infrastructure, or on infrastructure provided by a third-party provider. Private deployment models are often used for services that require high levels of security and control, such as enterprise applications and sensitive data.   
   
**Hybrid deployment models** provide users with a combination of public and private cloud services. In a hybrid deployment model, users can access some services over the public internet, and other services over a private network. Hybrid deployment models are often used for applications that require a combination of public and private cloud services, such as applications that need to access both public and sensitive data.
