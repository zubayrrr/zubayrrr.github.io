**Chupa Chups** (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈtʃupa ˈtʃups]) is a Spanish brand of lollipop and other confectionery sold in over 150 countries around the world. The brand was founded in 1958 by Enric Bernat. The name of the brand comes from the Spanish verb chupar, meaning "to suck".   
   
The Chupa Chups logo was designed in 1969 by the surrealist artist Salvador Dalí. Its first marketing campaign was the logo with the slogan "_Es redondo y dura mucho, Chupa Chups_", which translates from Spanish as "_It's round and long-lasting_". Later, celebrities like Madonna were hired to advertise the product.
