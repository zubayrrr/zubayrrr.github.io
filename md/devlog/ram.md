RAM is short for Random Access Memory, also referred to as volatile storage because it relies on a constant flow of electricity, when the power is turned off the contents of the RAM goes away.   
   
More RAM doesn't always mean better performance.   
   
   
- Parity uses a 9th error checking bit for every [Byte](../devlog/byte.md) of memory   
- Non-parity = doesn't have a 9th parity bit   
   
### Error correcting code   
   
   
- Some RAMs also support ECC - Error correcting code   
- Not only detects but also corrects common memory corruption issues   
- Often supported on non-ECC motherboards   
- Has to be enabled in [bios](../devlog/bios.md)/[uefi](../devlog/uefi.md)   
   
### SODIMM   
   
   
- Stands for - Small Outline Dual In-line Memory Module   
- Smaller RAM chips uses in laptops   
   
### DDR RAM   
   
   
- Stands for - Double data rate   
- Determinded by the [Motherboard](../devlog/motherboard.md)   
- Does _not_ have to be installed in pairs(as some of the older systems required)   
- Variations include DDR2, DDR3, DDR4 (varies in throughput)
