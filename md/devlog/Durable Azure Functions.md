Durable Azure Functions are a type of [Azure Function](/not_created.md) that allows users to write stateful, long-running, and resilient functions in the cloud. Durable Functions are built on top of Azure Functions, and provide additional features and capabilities that make it easier to write and manage complex, stateful applications in the cloud.   
   
Durable Functions allow users to write functions that can save state, and that can be resumed after failures or interruptions. This makes it easier to write functions that can handle long-running tasks, such as processing data in batches, or that need to maintain state across multiple function executions. Durable Functions also provide built-in support for orchestrating and coordinating the execution of multiple functions, allowing users to build complex, distributed applications.   
   
Azure Durable Functions are often used for tasks such as data processing, workflows, and coordination of [microservices](../devlog/microservices.md). They provide a powerful and scalable way to build stateful, event-driven applications in the cloud.
