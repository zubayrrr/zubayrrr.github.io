- Trivial File Transfer Protocol ([FTP](../devlog/ftp.md)), operates on [Port 69](/not_created.md)   
- Transmits files in both directions of a [Client](../devlog/client.md)-[Server](../devlog/server.md) application.   
- Used for booting an operating system from a local area network, file server.   
- It is also used to request configuration files from [router](../devlog/router.md)s and [Switch](../devlog/switch.md)es   
- Doesn't provide user authentication or directory visibility.   
- It is essentially a stripped down version of [FTP](../devlog/ftp.md)
