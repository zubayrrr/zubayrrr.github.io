An identity provider (IdP) is a service that stores and manages digital identities. Companies use these services to allow their employees or users to connect with the resources they need. They provide a way to manage access, adding or removing privileges, while security remains tight.   
   
If you've ever used your Google or Facebook login to access an app, you've used an IdP. Your username and password open doors to another resource, and you don't have to do anything special to make it happen.   
   
An [IdP workflow](https://securityboulevard.com/2019/03/what-is-an-identity-provider-idp/) typically involves:   
   
   
- **A request.** The user can enter credentials from another login (such as Google or Facebook or Twitter).   
- **Verification.** The IdP checks with a company's IT to determine if the user has access and what work that person is allowed to do.   
- **Unlocking.** The user gains access to the specified resources, and the visit is logged.   
   
This takes mere seconds, and most users don't notice all the hard work happening behind the screen.
