# [90 Linux Commands frequently used by Linux Sysadmins](https://haydenjames.io/90-linux-commands-frequently-used-by-linux-sysadmins/)   
   
There are well over 100 _Unix commands_ shared by the Linux kernel and other Unix-like operating systems. If you are interested in the commands frequently used by Linux sysadmins and power users, you’ve come to the place. Recently, I published a five-part series covering commands often used by Linux sysadmins.   
   
Below I’ve **listed the 90 commands** covered **and links to each of the five posts** in this series. Some of the commands listed include links to related articles. There are also thousands of commands available if we include downloadable software and scripts, such as [bpytop](https://github.com/aristocratos/bpytop) (pictured below). However, for this article’s purpose, we will cover mostly [Unix commands](http://mally.stanford.edu/~sr/computing/basic-unix.html) used on Linux by sysadmins and power users. If you find this page useful, let me know if you’d like to see similar posts in the future.

_I referred to commands as “Linux commands” since this blog and this article is specific to Linux admins and users. However, these are indeed [Unix](https://kb.iu.edu/d/afsk) [Commands](https://www.washington.edu/computing/unix/commands.html) for [Unix](https://www.opengroup.org/membership/forums/platform/unix) and other [Unix-like](https://www.tjhsst.edu/~dhyatt/superap/unixcmd.html) operating systems such as [Linux](https://haydenjames.io/tag/linux/)._
