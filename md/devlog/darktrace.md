Fundamentally, Darktrace is a cyber security vendor. What sets it apart, however, is its innovative use of AI or, more specifically, machine learning.   
   
At the core of all its products is Darktrace's Enterprise Immune System, an unsupervised machine learning technology and probabilistic mathematics. What this means in practice is that the software learns from the experience of analysing vast amounts of data by itself, without human intervention, and can adapt to a business's changing needs. It can also use probabilistic mathematics to determine how likely an attack is. â€” via [What is Darktrace? | IT PRO](https://www.itpro.co.uk/security/29150/what-is-darktrace)
