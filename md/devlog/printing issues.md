- Consider the printer type - troubleshooting varies depending on this.   
- Check the error thrown and determine the issue   
- Has anything in the IT environment changed?   
- Always consider the scope - who else is affected? (IT, subnets)   
- Incorrect/Corrupt driver, garbled output   
- Paper issues, wrong paper type, too much humidity, maybe static electricity?   
- Color issues: Check print job settings, incorrectly installed cartridges.   
- Security:   
  - Are correct printer permissions in place?   
  - Are drivers allowed to be installed? (if its not our job, escalate it)   
- Local Access to Printing Device (try printing from a USB)   
- Remove debris in paper feed path   
- Connect through a wired connection   
- Replace fusing assembly   
- Replace toner cartridge   
- Cleaning the imaging drum   
- Network connectivity
