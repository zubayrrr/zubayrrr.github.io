American Indians - Native Americans   
   
> The term "Indian," in reference to the original inhabitants of the American continent, is said to derive from Christopher Columbus, a 15th century boat-person. Some say he used the term because he was convinced he had arrived in "the Indies" (Asia), his intended destination.

Red Indian is an offensive term for a native North American. In North America, the term is now considered a racial slur. The use of the term Indian for the natives of the Americas originated with Christopher Columbus, who mistakenly believed that the Antilles were the islands of the Indian Ocean, known to Europeans as the Indies. Though Columbus’s mistake was soon recognized, the name stuck, and for centuries the native people of the Americas were called Indians.
