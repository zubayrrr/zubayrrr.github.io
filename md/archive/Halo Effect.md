The halo effect is a cognitive bias that refers to the tendency for our overall impression of a person, company, or product to influence our judgment of their other characteristics. This means that if we have a positive impression of someone, we are more likely to view their other traits and actions in a positive light as well. For example, if we think someone is attractive, we may also assume they are intelligent, kind, and successful. The halo effect can influence how we perceive and evaluate others in many different situations, such as during job interviews, on first dates, and when evaluating products.
