**Amatonormativity** is a set of societal assumptions that everyone prospers with an exclusive romantic relationship. Arizona State University professor of philosophy Elizabeth Brake coined the term to capture societal assumptions about romance. Brake wanted to describe the pressure she received by many to prioritize marriage in her own life when she did not want to. Amatonormativity extends beyond social pressures for marriage to include general pressures involving romance.
