When using two microphones to record a source, normally you will get the best results by placing the second mic no closer than three times the distance from the first mic that the first mic is from the source. This is known as the “3:1 Rule of Microphone Placement.”   
   
While many engineers believe that adhering to the 3:1 Rule will minimize phase cancellation, technically this is not true. The 3:1 Rule works because the level of the signal entering the second mic (the one farther away) is lower compared to the signal entering the first mic; tripling the distance substantially reduces the relative level of the signal in the two mics.
