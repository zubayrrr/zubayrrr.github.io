Azure Batch is a cloud-based service offered by Microsoft that enables users to run large-scale parallel and batch computing workloads on the Microsoft Azure platform. With Azure Batch, users can take advantage of Azure's scalable infrastructure to run their compute-intensive tasks, such as machine learning algorithms, image and video processing, and scientific simulations. Azure Batch can also be used to run batch jobs, such as ETL (extract, transform, and load) processes, that need to be run on a regular basis. Azure Batch makes it easy for users to set up and manage their batch computing workloads, allowing them to focus on their core business tasks instead of the underlying infrastructure.
