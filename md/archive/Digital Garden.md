A digital garden is a term used to describe an online space where a person can collect, organize, and cultivate their thoughts, ideas, and writing in a non-linear and organic way. It is typically a personal website or platform where a person can curate and grow their digital content in a way that resembles the process of gardening, with the website itself serving as the garden. Digital gardens are often used as a tool for personal reflection, self-expression, and creativity, and can be a helpful tool for organizing and sharing one's thoughts and ideas online.
