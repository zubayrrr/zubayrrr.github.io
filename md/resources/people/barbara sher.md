“Life isn't supposed to be an all or nothing battle between misery and bliss. Life isn't supposed to be a battle at all. And when it comes to happiness, well, sometimes life is just okay, sometimes it'comfortable, sometimes wonderful, sometimes boring, sometimes unpleasant. When your day's not perfect, it's not a failure or a terrible loss. It's just another day. ”     
― Barbara Sher   
   
“How can families harm us when they love us? Very easily, unfortunately. Most of us overlook one important fact when we think love is enough: Love and respect aren't the same thing.   
   
Love is fusion. As a baby, you belong to your parents, you're extension of them.   
   
Respect is differentiation: you belong to yourself, and you're an extension of no one.   
   
Differentiation is essential for happiness of adults.”

Do it because you love it.     
Stick with it.     
Start now.”     
― Barbara Sher   
   
“You can learn new things at any time in your life if you're willing to be a beginner. If you actually learn to like being a beginner, the whole world opens up to you.”     
― Barbara Sher   
   
“Doing is a quantum leap from imagining.”     
― Barbara Sher   
   
“You see, you’re not someone without direction; you’re an investigator, and the whole investigative process consists of learning a little bit about everything that looks interesting to you. If you respect your natural curiosity, you’ll come to trust your enthusiasm. It knows something about you. Your trail of enthusiasms is the most precise instrument you have for locating where you’d find the deepest satisfaction in your life.”
