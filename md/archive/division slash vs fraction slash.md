DIVISION SLASH(Unicode Character “∕” (U+2215)) is in the mathematical operators block. It is intended to be used when representing the mathematical division operator, e.g. in mathematical formulas. Use it when you might say, out loud, "1 divided by 2" or "x divided by y". It is also intended to be used in large fractions in mathematical contexts where the separator is horizontal.   
   
FRACTION SLASH(Unicode Character “⁄” (U+2044)) is in the general punctuation block. It is intended to be used when representing a fraction. Use it when you might say, out loud, "one half". You might use it in nonmathematical contexts, e.g. "1⁄2 cup of olive oil". In mathematical contexts it is intended to be used for fractions where the separator is skewed. — via [typography - Difference Between Unicode FRACTION SLASH and DIVISION SLASH - Super User](https://superuser.com/questions/922074/difference-between-unicode-fraction-slash-and-division-slash)

The solidus ( ⁄ ) is a punctuation mark used to indicate fractions including fractional currency. It may also be called a shilling mark, an in-line fraction bar, or a fraction slash. (...)   
   
The solidus is similar to another punctuation mark, the slash ( / ), which is found on standard keyboards; the slash is closer to being vertical than the solidus. These are two distinct symbols that traditionally have entirely different uses. However, many people no longer distinguish between them, and when there is no alternative it is acceptable to use the slash in place of the solidus. — via [meaning - What is the difference between "solidus" and "slash"? - English Language & Usage Stack Exchange](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/10993/what-is-the-difference-between-solidus-and-slash)
