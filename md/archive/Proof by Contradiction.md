Proof by contradiction, also known as indirect proof or reductio ad absurdum, is a method of proof in which a statement is shown to be true by demonstrating that the opposite statement leads to a logical contradiction.   
   
Proof by contradiction is often used to prove statements that may not have obvious direct proof. It can be a useful tool for demonstrating the truth of a statement by showing that the opposite statement leads to a logical absurdity.
