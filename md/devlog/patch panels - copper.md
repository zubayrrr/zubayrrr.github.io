updated: 1656501147105

- Patch Panels are devices with jacks to connect wiring from the jack to a network [Switch](../devlog/switch.md) in a flexible manner.   
- On the back of these patch panels there are [Punch Down Blocks](../devlog/punch%20down%20blocks.md), looks like a 110 Block.   
- On the front of the patch panel looks like a network jack, [RJ-45](../devlog/rj-45.md) jacks.   
- Patch panels are cheap and should be used as an intermediary between a plug and [Switch](../devlog/switch.md) to avoid damage to the Switch.
