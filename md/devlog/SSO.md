Single Sign-On (SSO) is an authentication and authorization process that allows a user to access multiple enterprise applications with a single set of login credentials (username and password). Simply stating SSO combines several application login screens into one, where you submit credentials once and get access to all applications without individually logging into each application. With SSO end-users time and efforts get minimized as they don't need to constantly sign in and out separately into a variety of web, on-premises, and cloud apps.   
Single Sign-On (SSO) is an important aspect of Identity and Access management ([IAM](../devlog/IAM.md)) or access control services. SSO solution implemented perfectly within an enterprise makes overall password management easier, improving productivity and security reducing the risk of lost, weak, or forgotten passwords.
