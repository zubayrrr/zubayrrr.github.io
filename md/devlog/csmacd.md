- [Ethernet](../devlog/ethernet.md) devices transmit based on a principle called Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Detect or CSMA/CD   
- Carrier Sense   
  - Listen to the wire, verify it is not busy   
- Multiple Access   
  - All devices have access at any time   
- Collision Detect   
  - If two deviecs transmit at the same time, a collision occurs   
  - Back off, wait a random time and try again
