**The following services could be used to deploy an application to servers running on-premises**.

- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is a simple best practice that adds an extra layer of protection on top of a username and password. With MFA enabled, when a user signs in to an AWS Management Console, they will be prompted for their username and password (the first factor—what they know), as well as for an authentication code from their MFA device (the second factor—what they have). Taken together, these multiple factors provide increased security for AWS account settings and resources.   
- A company can separate costs for network traffic, Amazon EC2, Amazon S3, and other AWS services by department by creating a separate AWS account for each department.   
- The benefit of consolidated billing for AWS accounts is combined usage volume discounts.   
- Updating Amazon EC2 host firmware is a responsibility of AWS in the shared responsibility model for security and compliance.
