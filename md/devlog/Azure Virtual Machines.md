Azure Virtual Machines (VMs) are cloud-based computing resources that you can use to run applications, host websites, and store data. VMs are based on the popular Windows and Linux operating systems, and they offer a wide range of sizes and configurations to meet your needs.   
   
With Azure VMs, you can create and configure virtual machines quickly and easily, without the need to purchase and manage physical hardware. Azure VMs are fully managed by Microsoft, so you don't need to worry about patching, backups, or system updates.   
   
Azure VMs are available in several different pricing tiers, including pay-as-you-go and reserved instances. Pay-as-you-go VMs are charged on an hourly basis, and you can scale them up or down as needed. Reserved instances are more cost-effective, but require you to commit to a one- or three-year term.   
   
To create an Azure VM, you can use the [Azure Portal](/not_created.md), [Azure CLI](/not_created.md), or [Azure PowerShell](/not_created.md). You can choose from a range of predefined VM sizes, or you can create a custom VM configuration. You can also attach data disks to your VMs for additional storage, and you can use [Azure managed disks](../devlog/Azure%20Managed%20Disks.md) for improved reliability and performance.   
   
Once the VM is running, you can connect to it remotely and manage it just like a physical server. You can also use Azure tools and services, such as [Azure Monitor](../devlog/Azure%20Monitor.md), to monitor and manage your VMs.
