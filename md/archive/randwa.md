“Randwa” does not mean a Gigolo or a male prostitute or whore-monger as many of the answers in the thread will have you believe.   
   
This confusion stems from the fact that one of the derogatory Hindi words for a female sex worker is “Randi”, so people usually assume that “Randwa” is the male form of the word, (Despite the fact that this is inconsistent with Hindi Grammar rules) hence the answers.   
   
Randwa means a male person whose wife has died or has left him. The word however is not considered polite and used in an offensive manner. Because reminding a man in India that his wife has left him or he has not been able to remarry after death of his wife is offensive to his fragile male ego.
