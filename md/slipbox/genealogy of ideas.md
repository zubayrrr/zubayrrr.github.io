Every new idea is remix/mashup of one or more previous ideas.   
   
This new idea will be bigger than the sum of its parts or whatever ideas that it emerged from.   
   
You don't get to choose what genes you're born with, it depends on your parents, you're a remix of your both parent's genes.   
   
Just as you have familial genealogy, you also have a genealogy of ideas.   
   
You get to pick your teachers, your friends, your influences, your taste in music, the books you read.   
   
You're the product of what you let in to your life, the product of your influences.
