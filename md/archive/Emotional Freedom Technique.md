Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT) is a form of psychological acupressure that involves tapping on specific points on the body while focusing on a particular issue or problem. It is based on the idea that negative emotions and thoughts can disrupt the body's energy system, and that tapping on specific points can help to restore balance and improve overall well-being.   
   
EFT involves tapping with the fingertips on specific points on the face, hands, and upper body while repeating phrases related to the issue being addressed. The tapping is believed to help release negative emotions and thoughts, and promote feelings of calm and balance. EFT is often used to address a wide range of issues, including anxiety, stress, phobias, trauma, and addiction. It is also used to improve physical symptoms such as chronic pain, headaches, and digestive problems.   
   
EFT is considered a complementary or alternative therapy, and while it has gained some popularity, it is not yet widely accepted by the mainstream medical community. More research is needed to fully understand the effectiveness of EFT and to determine its potential uses in the treatment of various conditions.
