I have never let my schooling interfere with my education. – Mark Twain   
   
> Grant Allen wrote “No schooling was allowed to interfere with my education” in a variety of permutations. QI believes he probably originated the saying, and he clearly attempted to popularize it. However, Allen was a controversial figure and the maxim was reassigned to Mark Twain by 1907. — via [Never Let Schooling Interfere With Your Education – Quote Investigator](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2010/09/25/schooling-vs-education/)
