The term "second brain" is often used to refer to a personal system or platform that a person uses to collect, organize, and reflect on their thoughts, ideas, and information. This might include things like a digital garden, a personal website, a note-taking app, or even a physical notebook or journal. The idea is that these tools can serve as an external "brain" where a person can store and organize their knowledge, much like the brain in their skull stores and processes information. By using a second brain, a person can more easily access and reflect on their knowledge, and can also share it with others if they choose to.
