Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS) is a service that allows users to deploy and manage a large number of identical virtual machines (VMs) as a single unit. It provides a way to scale out applications horizontally, allowing users to easily and automatically increase or decrease the number of VMs in a scale set based on demand.   
   
VMSS allows users to create and manage a group of identical, load balanced VMs that can automatically scale in or out based on demand. This allows users to easily and cost-effectively scale their applications to meet changing workloads. VMSS also provides built-in high availability and fault tolerance, ensuring that applications remain available even if individual VMs fail.   
   
VMSS integrates with other Azure services, such as [Azure Load Balancer](/not_created.md), [Azure Monitor](../devlog/Azure%20Monitor.md), and [Azure Storage](../devlog/Azure%20Storage.md), allowing users to easily access and manage their VMs. It also supports both Windows and Linux VMs, and allows users to use their own custom images or pre-built images from the Azure Marketplace.
