A **Causal loop** is a theoretical proposition in which, by means of either retrocausality or time travel, an event (an action, information, object, or person) is among the causes of another event, which is in turn among the causes of the first-mentioned event. Such causally looped events then exist in spacetime, but their origin cannot be determined. A hypothetical example of a causality loop is given of a billiard ball striking its past self: the billiard ball moves in a path towards a time machine, and the future self of the billiard ball emerges from the time machine before its past self enters it, giving its past self a glancing blow, altering the past ball's path and causing it to enter the time machine at an angle that would cause its future self to strike its past self the very glancing blow that altered its path. In this sequence of events, the change in the ball's path is its own cause, which might appear paradoxical.Other terms for "causal loop" are bootstrap paradox, information paradox, ontological paradox, self-sufficient loop, and predestination paradox; see ยง terminology.

The bootstrap paradox is **a hypothetical causal loop in time travel in which one event causes a second, which was actually the cause of the first**.
