Azure Advanced Threat Protection (Azure ATP) is a cloud-based security service provided by Microsoft Azure that helps organizations to protect against advanced cyber threats. It uses machine learning and behavioral analytics to identify and alert on potential security threats, such as malware, ransomware, and advanced persistent threats, in order to help organizations to quickly respond to and mitigate these threats.   
   
It consists of the following components:   
   
   
-   Azure ATP sensors: these are lightweight agents that are installed on domain controllers to collect security-related data, such as user login information, authentication events, and network traffic.   
-   Azure ATP cloud service: this is the cloud-based service that processes the data collected by the Azure ATP sensors, and uses machine learning and behavioral analytics to identify and alert on potential security threats.   
-   Azure ATP portal: this is the web-based interface that provides access to the Azure ATP cloud service, and allows users to view alerts, investigate threats, and manage Azure ATP settings.   
   
It also integrates with other Azure security services, such as [Azure Security Center](../devlog/Azure%20Security%20Center.md) and [Azure Sentinel](/not_created.md), to provide a comprehensive security solution for Azure workloads.
