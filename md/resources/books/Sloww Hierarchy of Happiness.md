## How to be Happy Externally   
   
By “external,” I mean factors that are outside yourself. We’ll be taking a look at [money](../../topics/money.md), [simplicity](../../topics/simplicity.md), [relationships](../../topics/relationships.md), and [culture](../../topics/culture.md).   
   
## Sloww Hierarchy of Happiness — Money   
   
Happiness can be “bought” up to a point (aim for the ever-elusive enough)   
   
Having too little or too much money can have negative effects.   
   
> Happiness is a place between too little and too much. — Finnish Proverb   
   
Money only affects emotional well-being (happiness) up to an annual   
income of $60,000-$75,000.   
   
At $40K, health, relationships, and purpose become more important. Around $50K, more income had no relationship with day-to-day happiness   
   
> Once a person or family reaches a moderate level of income, here are the factors that research has shown contribute most to happiness: good health, personal growth, strong social relationships, service to others, connection with nature. — Duane Elgin   
   
Why doesn’t more money keep buying us more happiness? The   
answer may be related to the [hedonic treadmill](../../archive/hedonic%20treadmill.md) (or hedonic adaptation):   
   
The hedonic treadmill, also known as hedonic adaptation, is the observed   
tendency of humans to quickly return to a relatively stable level   
of happiness despite major positive or negative events or life   
changes. According to this theory, as a person makes more money, expectations and desires rise in tandem, which results in no permanent gain in happiness...   
   
Hedonic adaptation is a process or mechanism that reduces the affective impact of emotional events. Generally, hedonic adaptation involves a happiness ‘set point’, whereby humans generally maintain a constant level of   
happiness throughout their lives, despite events that occur in their   
environment. The process of hedonic adaptation is often conceptualized as a   
treadmill, since one must continually work to maintain a certain level of happiness.   
   
Others conceptualize hedonic adaptation as functioning similarly to a thermostat (a negative feedback system) that works to maintain an individual’s happiness set point.   
   
> If you worship money and things — if they are where you tap real meaning in life — then you will never have enough. Never feel you have enough ... On one level, we all know this stuff already ... The trick is keeping the truth up-front in daily [consciousness](../../topics/consciousness.md). — [David Foster Wallace](../../resources/people/David%20Foster%20Wallace.md), This is Water   
   
> People who live far below their means enjoy a freedom that people busy upgrading their lifestyles can’t fathom. — [Naval Ravikant](/not_created.md)   
   
> For too long we have been dreaming a dream from which we are now waking up: the dream that if we just improve the socioeconomic situation of people, everything will be okay, people will become happy. The truth is that as the struggle for survival has subsided, the question has emerged: survival for what? Ever more people today have the means to live, but no meaning to live for. — [Viktor Frankl](/not_created.md)   
   
   
   
## Sloww Hierarchy of Happiness — Simplicity   
   
**Simplicity of possessions**   
   
> Most smart people over time realize that possessions don’t make them happy. You have to go through that ... As you get older, you just realize that there’s no happiness in material possessions. — [Naval Ravikant](/not_created.md)   
   
> I can think of no greater happiness in life than to be surrounded only by the things I love. How about you? — [Marie Kondo](/not_created.md), The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up   
   
> Everyone started out a minimalist. Our worth is not the sum of our belongings. Possessions can make us happy only for brief periods. Unnecessary material objects suck up our time, our energy, and our freedom. — [Fumio Sasaki](/not_created.md), Goodbye, Things   
   
> Appoint certain days on which to give up everything and make yourself at home with next to nothing ... For no one is worthy of god unless he has paid no heed to riches. I am not, mind you, against your possessing them, but I want to ensure that you possess them without tremors; and this you will only achieve in one way, by convincing yourself that you can live a happy life even without them, and by always regarding them as being on the point of vanishing. — Seneca   
   
**Simplicity of life**   
   
> A quiet and modest life brings more joy than a pursuit of success bound with constant unrest. — Einstein   
   
> May I not also say that the simplest pleasures are the most enduring, the commonest delights are the most invigorating, the form of happiness which is the most easily available is the best? The further we stray from Nature the harder are we to please, and he knows the truest pleasure who can find it in the simplest forms. — W. J. Dawson   
   
> We need examples of people who, leaving to Heaven to decide whether they are to rise in the world, decide for themselves that they will be happy in it, and have resolved to seek—not greater wealth, but simpler pleasure, not higher fortune, but deeper felicity; making the first of possessions, self-possession. — Ruskin   
   
> Happiness is simple pleasures, is spending time doing what you love and spending time with those you love. — Leo Babauta   
   
> A monastic life is characterized by simple beauty and unexpected joy. Monks find happiness in things that may seem trivial to those who pursue the material trappings of success. Watching the seasons change—the blossoming of the magnolias, the dazzling fall foliage, the first snowfall—brings indescribable joy and gratitude. — Haemin Sunim, The Things You Can See Only When You Slow Down   
   
> The technologist and psychologist Sep Kamvar ran a bit of a social experiment ... and found that young people and old people define happiness in distinct ways. Young people tend to speak about happiness in terms of excitement. Older people tend to speak about happiness in terms of peacefulness. For young people, happiness was accomplishment. For their elders, it was contentment. — Ryan Holiday, Stillness is the Key   
   
> In the 1980s, simplicity was seen primarily as ‘downshifting,’ or pulling back from the rat race of consumer society. Several decades later, there is a growing recognition of simplicity as ‘upshifting’ — or moving beyond the rat race to the human race. Increasingly, the mainstream media and society are recognizing how people’s search for happiness is taking them beyond consumerism to a more balanced and integrated approach to living. — Duane Elgin   
   
   
   
## Sloww Hierarchy of Happiness – Relationships   
   
> The first is that social connections are really good for us, and that loneliness kills. It turns out that people who are more socially connected to family, to friends, to community, are happier, they’re physically healthier, and they live longer than people who are less well connected ... And we know that you can be lonely in a crowd and you can be lonely in a marriage, so the second big lesson that we learned is that it’s not just the number of friends you have, and it’s not whether or not you’re in a committed relationship, but it’s the quality of your close relationships that matters ... And the third big lesson that we learned about relationships and our health is that good relationships don’t just protect our bodies, they protect our brains.   
   
> Emotional happiness is primarily social ... The very best thing that can happen to people is to spend time with other people they like. That is when they are happiest. — Dr. Daniel Kahneman   
   
> One of the best ways to make yourself happy is to make other people happy; one of the best ways to make other people happy is to be happy yourself. — Gretchen Rubin   
   
   
   
   
## Sloww Hierarchy of Happiness – Culture

> Perhaps Danish happiness is not really happiness at all, but something much more valuable and durable: contentedness, being satisfied with your lot, low-level needs being met, higher expectations being kept in check.

> A man is not rightly conditioned until he is a happy, healthy, and prosperous being; and happiness, health, and prosperity are the result of a harmonious adjustment of the inner with the outer... — James Allen, As a Man Thinketh   
   
> The essence of philosophy ... happiness shall depend as little as possible on external things. — [Epictetus](../../resources/people/epictetus.md)   
   
> So if you want to live, you must have no permanent abode. You must have no place to rest your head. You have to flow with it. As the great Confucius said, ‘The one who would be constant in happiness must frequently change.’ Flow. — Anthony de Mello, Awareness   
   
## Sloww Hierarchy of Happiness – Expectations   
   
Mo Gawdat’s tip on happiness:    
   
The way we think about the events of our life and compare them to   
realistic expectations is what makes us happy or unhappy.   
   
> Happiness is very much like staying fit. You start with the decision that you are going to get fit, you find out how – but knowing that is not enough, you have to go to the gym to work out and eat healthily. To me the whole topic of happiness is exactly the same. First you understand that happiness is a choice, that you can actually achieve it and that there is a method to make it happen. Happiness is not a coincidence, it is not given to you by life, it’s entirely our responsibility.   
   
## Sloww Hierarchy of Happiness – Practice   
   
> I’d always believed that a life of quality, enjoyment, and wisdom were my human birthright ... I never suspected that I would have to learn how to live ... ways of seeing the world I had to master before I could awaken to a simple, happy, uncomplicated life. — Dan Millman   
   
Practice until it becomes second nature.   
   
> In every moment, in everything that happens, you can look on the bright side of something. So I used to do that forcibly and then I trained it until it became second nature. — Naval Ravikant   
   
## Sloww Hierarchy of Happiness – Choice   
   
> If you want to be happy, be. — Leo Tolstoy   
   
> Happiness is also a choice. If you’re so smart, how come you aren’t happy? How come you haven’t figured that out? That’s my challenge to all the people who think they’re so smart and so capable. — Naval Ravikant   
   
> Happiness is a choice. You are as happy as you choose to be. If you don’t know how to be happy with what you have, you will never be happy with more. — Rick Warren, The Purpose Driven Life   
   
> The happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts. — Marcus Aurelius   
   
> Individuals who understand what brings them joy and happiness tend to have what we like to call the Right Outlook. They are engulfed in activities and communities that allow them to immerse themselves in a rewarding and gratifying environment.   
   
## Sloww Hierarchy of Happiness – Purpose   
   
**Happiness is a byproduct of finding meaning and purpose**   
   
> I’ve learned that there is nothing more consistent with unhappiness than spending your time in a way that doesn’t serve who you are ... there is no more profound source of fulfillment and happiness than knowing you are traveling your own path... — Scott Dinsmore   
   
> ‘Years of research on the psychology of well-being have demonstrated that often human beings are happiest when they are engaged in meaningful pursuits and virtuous activities.’ Indeed, when we are deeply engaged in an activity that is in accordance with our best self, we often report the highest levels of life satisfaction. — Scientific American   
   
> Very few follow the path laid out for them—the path to their Personal Legends, and to happiness. — Paulo Coelho   
   
> Happiness cannot be pursued; it must ensue. One must have a reason to ‘be happy.’ Once the reason is found, however, one becomes happy automatically. As we see, a human being is not one in pursuit of happiness but rather in search of a reason to become happy, last but not least, through actualizing the potential meaning inherent and dormant in a given situation.— [Viktor Frankl](/not_created.md), Man’s Search for Meaning   
   
> Pleasure is, and must remain, a side-effect or by-product, and is destroyed and spoiled to the degree to which it is made a goal in itself. — [Viktor Frankl](/not_created.md)   
   
> Once an individual’s search for a meaning is successful, it not only renders him happy but also gives him the capability to cope with suffering. — [Viktor Frankl](/not_created.md)   
   
> The difference between happiness and fulfillment is the difference between liking something and loving something ... Happiness comes from what we do. Fulfillment comes from why we do it. — [Simon Sinek](/not_created.md)   
   
Instead of making happiness the goal, focus on meaning and purpose.   
   
> Many persons have a wrong idea of what constitutes true happiness. It is not attained through self-gratification but through fidelity to a worthy purpose. — Helen Keller   
   
> Our deepest happiness in life stems from fulfilling purpose. Doing the best we can, where we are, with what we’ve been given is the best way to live a life of meaning and significance. — Joshua Becker
