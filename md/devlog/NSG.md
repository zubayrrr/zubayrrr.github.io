NSG is a common abbreviation for "network security group". In the context of IT, a network security group is a virtual [firewall](../devlog/firewall.md) that controls network traffic to and from resources in a virtual network. NSGs are used to enforce network security policies, allowing administrators to control which traffic is allowed to reach the resources in a virtual network. NSGs can be used to secure traffic within a virtual network, as well as between virtual networks, and between a virtual network and the internet.
