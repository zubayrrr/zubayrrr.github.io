`groupdel` command is used to delete an existing [group](/not_created.md)   
   
Syntax:   
   
`sudo groupdel groupName`   
   
   
- On successful deletion it doesn't print any output   
- It is not possible to delete the primary group of an existing user without first removing the user with [userdel](../devlog/userdel.md)
