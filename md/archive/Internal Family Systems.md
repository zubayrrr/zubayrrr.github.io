Internal Family Systems (IFS) is a model of psychotherapy developed by Dr. Richard C. Schwartz. It is a form of psychotherapy that helps individuals understand and work with the various parts or "subpersonalities" within their psyche. These subpersonalities may have different thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, and they often play a role in shaping our experiences and responses to the world around us.   
   
IFS is based on the idea that each individual has a "core self" or "true self" that is naturally curious, compassionate, and accepting. This core self is surrounded by a variety of subpersonalities that may have formed as a result of past experiences, including feelings of shame, fear, and pain. IFS aims to help individuals access their core self and work with their subpersonalities in a compassionate and healing way.   
   
In IFS therapy, the therapist helps the individual identify and work with their subpersonalities in order to gain insight into their own experiences and behaviors. The goal of this process is to help the individual integrate their subpersonalities and learn to make choices that are aligned with their core values and goals.   
   
IFS can be a helpful tool for self-improvement as it helps individuals understand and work with the various parts of themselves that may be causing discomfort or holding them back. By learning to access their core self and work with their subpersonalities in a compassionate and accepting way, individuals can develop greater self-awareness and make choices that are more in line with their values and goals.
