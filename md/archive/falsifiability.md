The Falsification Principle, proposed by Karl Popper, is a way of demarcating science from non-science. It suggests that for a theory to be considered scientific it must be able to be tested and conceivably proven false.   
For example, the hypothesis that "all swans are white," can be falsified by observing a black swan.   
For Popper, science should attempt to disprove a theory, rather than attempt to continually support theoretical hypotheses.   
   
[Karl Popper](/not_created.md) argued that science would best progress using [deductive reasoning](/not_created.md) (as opposed to [inductive reasoning](/not_created.md)) as its primary emphasis, known as critical rationalism.
