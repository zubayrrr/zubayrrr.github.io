3.  Set up a workflow that automatically closes stale pull requests after a certain period of time.   
4.  Create a workflow that automatically generates a release and deploys your code to production whenever a new tag is pushed to your repository.   
5.  Set up a workflow that runs code quality checks (e.g. linting, static analysis) on every push to your repository.   
6.  Create a workflow that automatically triggers a rebuild and redeployment of your application whenever a change is made to a specific dependency (e.g. a package in your `package.json` file).

14.  Create a workflow that automatically builds and publishes a Docker image to a registry whenever a new tag is pushed to your repository.   
15.  Set up a workflow that automatically triggers a rollback to the previous version of your application whenever a deployment to production fails.
