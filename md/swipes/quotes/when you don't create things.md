> when you don't create things, you become defined by your tastes rather than ability. your tastes only narrow & exclude people. so create. — Why The Lucky Stiff   
   
> The quote suggests that by creating things, we can define ourselves by our abilities and skills rather than simply our tastes or preferences. It also suggests that our tastes can narrow and exclude others, while creation allows us to expand and include others. This idea encourages people to be actively involved in creating things and contributing to the world around them, rather than simply consuming or appreciating the creations of others. — [ChatGPT](../../devlog/ChatGPT.md)
