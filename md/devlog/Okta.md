Okta employs [SAML](../devlog/SAML.md) (Security Assertion Markup Language), SCIML (System for Cross-domain Identity Management), and SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) techniques to enable access to multiple applications with just one set of credentials, to manage user identity for cloud-based or on-premise applications or services. Thus, raising an alert when there is a sign-in from a geolocation in a country other than the company’s.   
   
### Features Of Okta   
   
#### 1. Single Sign-On :   
   
The feature allows you to log in to your Okta account from any device — a laptop, PC, even your mobile while you are working. It is the most noteworthy feature of Okta that puts it ahead of its competitors.   
   
#### 2. Multi Factor Authentication (MFA) :   
   
Refers to a prudent form of secondary security. An MFA is set initially along with the password. So, even if there is a slight chance that the password is hacked, it is difficult to answer a secondary question whose answer only an original user knows. You can set the MFA to be a personal question of your choice or change it to an OTP sent to your mobile when unusual activity is tracked or scan your fingerprint or face as a biometric lock to safeguard from intruders.   
   
#### 3. Lifecycle Management :   
   
Okta collects all the information about the user, such as his position in the company, his job title, the group he belongs to, the applications he has access to, and other such information and records it in the directory to make the onboarding and off-boarding procedure easier.   
   
#### 4. Universal Directory :   
   
Informs ‘what’ application or site was used, by ‘whom’, and ‘when’. The Okta universal directory fuses the AD (Active Directory), [LDAP](../devlog/ldap.md) (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol), and other third-party identity provider SaaS apps like G Suite and CSV files for better management.    
   
#### 5. API Access Management :   
   
Okta also accommodates the introduction of new customised applications and APIs (Application Programming Interface). It secures and only provides access to the apps as well as the APIs they operate on based on the policies set by you.    
   
#### 6. Advanced Server Access :   
   
Okta, using the Single Sign-On, gives access to apps not just till the browser but right down deep to the back-end servers those apps operate on to avoid the re-sign-in trigger once you reopen an app.****
