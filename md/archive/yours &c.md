Sometimes used as "I am \&c"   
   
"\&c" is shorthand for etc. or et cetera, is used in a [valediction](/not_created.md) by a writer (letter or novel)   
   
> "Yours, etc." is used historically for abbreviated endings. It can be found in older newspaper letters to the editor, and often in US legal correspondence. "\&c." may be seen as an alternative abbreviation of et cetera, the ampersand functioning as a ligature form of "et". "I am, etc." and "I remain, etc." are also used.—via [Valediction - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valediction#Other_forms)   
   
Yours truly; Truly yours; Respectfully yours; Yours respectfully; or, if it is desired to give more emphasis, the adverb very may be added, as, Very truly yours; Yours very respectfully.
