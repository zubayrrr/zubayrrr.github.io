…out of my answers there grew new questions, inquiries, conjectures, probabilities — until at length I had a country of my own, a soil of my own, an entire discrete, thriving, flourishing world, like a secret garden the existence of which no one suspected. — Oh how fortunate we are, we men of knowledge, provided only that we know now to keep silent long enough!” ([friedrich nietzsche](../../resources/people/friedrich%20nietzsche.md), On the Genealogy of Morals, translated by Walter Kaufmann, Preface, section 3)
