`patch` is a command that takes the output from the [diff](../devlog/diff.md) and puts it into a file. Then, it can take the filed output and overwrite another file with with the changes. For example, a common use is to use the patch to transfer changes from the changed file to the original file, thus making them identical. While this can also be accomplished by copy/pasting the updated file into the original file, patch is much faster and efficient.   
   
   
- \-b Creates a backup of the original file   
- \-i Forces the command to read the patch from the .patch file instead of from standard input   
- \-p\[\#\] Instructs the command to strip \# number of slashes from the filepath to the filename. You’ll see in most of our examples, we use -p0 so that no slashes are stripped away   
- \-R Reverses the previous patch   
- \-s Runs the command silently. It will only show process if there are errors

Example scenario:   
   
Suppose a new bug was discovered that needed to be patched, the developer needs to make changes to the source code, instead of releasing a completely new program, the developer instead releases a `patch file` that contains difference ([diff](../devlog/diff.md)) for that file that contains the bug and what changes are needed to be made to make the bug go away.   
   
This `patch file` was generated by the [diff](../devlog/diff.md) command by comparing the source files of the bugged program and the rectified program. The patch can now be applied to the bugged program using the patch tool.
