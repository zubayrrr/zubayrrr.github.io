Habeas corpus, literally meaning "let you have the body", and in context meaning "[we, a Court, command] that you have the body [of the detainee brought before us].") is a recourse in law through which a person can report an unlawful detention or imprisonment to a court and request that the court order the custodian of the person, usually a prison official, to bring the prisoner to court, to determine whether the detention is lawful.
