> What is t-shirt sizing?    
> T-shirt sizing is a project estimation and capacity planning tool that helps you track how much time or effort an initiative will take. To do this, you assign each project or task a t-shirt size—from Extra Small to XXL—to represent that task’s relative effort. Depending on how you choose to use this tool, a t-shirt size can represent task scope, effort, complexity, work hours, time estimates—or all of the above. — via [How to use T-Shirt Sizing to Estimate Projects • Asana](https://asana.com/resources/t-shirt-sizing)
