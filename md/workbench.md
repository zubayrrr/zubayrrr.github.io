"Cyber-samadhi" is a term that refers to a state of intense concentration or focus that is achieved while engaging with digital media or technology. It is similar to the concept of samadhi in Hinduism and Buddhism, which refers to a state of heightened awareness and enlightenment that is achieved through meditation and spiritual practice.   
   
In the context of "cyber-samadhi," the term suggests that it is possible to achieve a similar state of concentration and focus through engagement with technology, such as by using a computer, playing video games, or using virtual reality. Some people may find that they are able to enter a state of "cyber-samadhi" while engaging with digital media, particularly when they are involved in activities that require a high level of focus and attention, such as coding or designing.   
   
It is important to note that while "cyber-samadhi" may be a useful concept for describing the intense focus that is possible while engaging with technology, it is not a term that is widely recognized or used in mainstream discourse. Some people may find the concept of "cyber-samadhi" to be a helpful way of thinking about the impact of technology on the brain and human consciousness, while others may view it as a somewhat fanciful or oversimplified way of describing the effects of technology on our attention and focus.
