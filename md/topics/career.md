## Common salary negotiation mistakes   
   
1. Not negotiating   
   
   - Everyone expects you to negotiate   
2. Skipping research   
   
   - Know what the market is paying for your position.   
3. Fear of losing offer   
   
   - Having a backup plan will allow you to negotiate fearlessly. Most common backup plan is to hove another offer   
4. Not practicing   
   
   - Practice starting a conversation, setting the context, common questions and also importantly when to shut up.

## Career Moat   
   
> A career moat is an individual’s ability to maintain competitive advantages over your competition (say, in the job market) in order to protect your long term prospects, your employability, and your ability to generate sufficient financial returns to support the life you want to live. Just like a medieval castle, the moat serves to protect those inside the fortress and their riches from outsiders.
