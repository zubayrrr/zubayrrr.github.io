## Identity Governance and Administration   
   
IGA is both a policy framework and set of [security solutions](https://www.coresecurity.com/products/access-assurance-suite) that enable organizations to more effectively mitigate identity-related access risks within their business. IGA automates the [creation](https://www.coresecurity.com/products/core-access), management, and certification of user accounts, roles, and access rights for individual users in an organization. This means companies can streamline user [provisioning](https://www.coresecurity.com/products/core-provisioning), [password management](https://www.coresecurity.com/products/core-password), policy management, access governance, and [access reviews](https://www.coresecurity.com/products/core-certify) within their business.   
   
Considered part of Identity and Access Management([IAM](../devlog/IAM.md)), Identity Governance and Administration offers organizations increased visibility into the identities and access privileges of users, so they can better manage who has access to what systems, and when.   
   
‘IGA differs from IAM in that it allows organizations to not only define and enforce IAM policy, but also connect IAM functions to meet audit and compliance requirements.’ This means Identity Governance and Administration has the distinct purpose to ensure IAM policies are connected and enforced.   
   
## Why Identity Governance is Important   
   
An enterprise has a variety of different types of users that comprise your **user population**. Each of them connects to different system through entitlements. With many different systems in an enterprise, different connections can result in clutter and mess of an organization.   
   
Not all entitlements are created equally, some folks can do privileged activities while others can access just the non-critical systems.   
   
**How to provide simple yet secure access and ensure it is the right access?**   
   
Identity Governance impacts three key areas:   
   
   
- Security    
	- Data breaches   
- Regulations   
	- PCI, GDPR etc   
- IT Ops   
	- Operational efficiency   
	- Help desk calls etc
