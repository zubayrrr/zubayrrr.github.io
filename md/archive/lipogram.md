A lipogram is a type of writing that intentionally omits one or more letters of the alphabet. A lipogrammatic work is a piece of writing that is composed entirely of lipograms. Lipogrammatic writing can be a form of artistic expression or a way to challenge oneself to create a work of literature using a limited set of letters.   
   
Here are a few examples of lipogrammatic works:   
   
1.  "A Void" by Georges Perec: This novel is a lipogram that omits the letter "e" throughout the entire text. It is a story about a man who disappears and the efforts of his friends and family to find him.   
       
2.  "For Esme - With Love and Squalor" by J.D. Salinger: This short story is a lipogram that omits the letter "e" except for the title. It is a story about a young soldier who meets a girl named Esme before being deployed to fight in World War II.   
       
3.  "The Quick Brown Fox Jumps Over the Lazy Dog" by Unknown: This is a well-known phrase that uses every letter of the alphabet at least once. It is often used as a test of keyboard functionality or as a way to demonstrate the use of all letters in the alphabet.   
       
4.  "A is for Apple" by Unknown: This is a simple lipogrammatic poem that omits the letter "e" except for the title. It is a rhyming poem that uses all the other letters of the alphabet to name different fruits and vegetables.   
       
5.  "The Lipogrammatist's Revenge" by Unknown: This is a lipogrammatic story that omits the letter "e" throughout the entire text. It is a story about a man who seeks revenge against a group of people who have wronged him, using only words that do not contain the letter "e."
