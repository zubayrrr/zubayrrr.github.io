**dmesg** is a display message command that display kernel-related messages on Unix-like systems. It used to control the kernel ring buffer. The output contains messages produced by the device drivers.   
   
All the messages received from the kernel ring buffer is displayed when we execute the command **“dmesg”**, here only the latest messages will be shown. This is used to check messages stored in the kernel ring buffer. In the case of non-root user use **“sudo”** to run root-level commands without being root.
