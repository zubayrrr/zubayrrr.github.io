Running containerized applications (without the need to provision virtual machines).   
   
Azure Container Instances is a service that makes it easy to create and manage containers in the cloud. It allows users to quickly and easily deploy containers without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure, such as virtual machines or container orchestration. This makes it a convenient and scalable way to run applications in the cloud.   
   
With Azure Container Instances, users can create containers using their own Docker images or pre-built images from the Azure Container Registry or Docker Hub. They can then manage and scale their containers using the [Azure portal](/not_created.md), [Azure CLI](/not_created.md), or [Azure Resource Manager](../devlog/Azure%20Resource%20Manager.md) templates.   
   
Azure Container Instances also integrates with other Azure services, such as [Azure Storage](../devlog/Azure%20Storage.md) and [Azure Monitor](../devlog/Azure%20Monitor.md), allowing users to easily access and monitor their containers. Additionally, it provides features such as automatic scaling and load balancing to help users manage their applications more effectively.
