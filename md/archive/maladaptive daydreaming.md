Maladaptive daydreaming is a psychiatric condition. It was identified by Professor Eliezer Somer of the University of Haifa in Israel.   
This condition causes intense daydreaming that distracts a person from their real life. Many times, real-life events trigger day dreams. These events can include:   
   
   
- topics of conversation   
- sensory stimuli such as noises or smells   
- physical experiences
