## Windows File System   
   
   
- It has multiple roots called drives.   
- Within those drives, the hierarchy of files and folders is same.   
- **Not everything is a file** unlike the [unix](/not_created.md) OSes.   
  - Devices are not treated as files.   
- Windows uses backslashes (`\`) instead of forward slash like in [unix](/not_created.md) for paths.   
- Apps files are not split into different directories when installing them. They're installed at one location.   
- Windows uses different shell commands, most commands available on [linux](../topics/linux.md) are not available on Windows.
