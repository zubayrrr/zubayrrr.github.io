Consciousness, at its simplest, is sentience or awareness of internal and external existence. Despite millennia of analyses, definitions, explanations and debates by philosophers and scientists, consciousness remains puzzling and controversial, being "at once the most familiar and [also the] most mysterious aspect of our lives". Perhaps the only widely agreed notion about the topic is the intuition that consciousness exists. Opinions differ about what exactly needs to be studied and explained as consciousness. Sometimes, it is synonymous with the mind, and at other times, an aspect of mind. In the past, it was one's "inner life", the world of introspection, of private thought, imagination and volition. Today, it often includes any kind of cognition, experience, feeling or perception. It may be awareness, awareness of awareness, or self-awareness either continuously changing or not. There might be different levels or orders of consciousness, or different kinds of consciousness, or just one kind with different features. Other questions include whether only humans are conscious, all animals, or even the whole universe. The disparate range of research, notions and speculations raises doubts about whether the right questions are being asked.   
   
Examples of the range of descriptions, definitions or explanations are: simple wakefulness, one's sense of selfhood or soul explored by "looking within"; being a metaphorical "stream" of contents, or being a mental state, mental event or mental process of the brain; having phanera or qualia and subjectivity; being the 'something that it is like' to 'have' or 'be' it; being the "inner theatre" or the executive control system of the mind.

## Spotlight consciousness and Lantern Consciousness   
   
Generally speaking, we have two kinds of consciousness. One I will call the “spotlight,” and the other the “floodlight.” The spotlight is what we call conscious attention, and we are trained from childhood that it is the most valuable form of perception. When the teacher in class says “Pay attention!” everybody stares, and looks right at the teacher. That is spotlight consciousness; fixing your mind on one thing at a time. You concentrate, and even though you may not be able to have a very long attention span, nevertheless you use your spotlight: one thing after another, one thing after another…   
   
However we also have floodlight consciousness. For example, you can drive your car for several miles with a friend sitting next to you, and be completely absorbed in talking to your friend. Nevertheless, your floodlight consciousness will manage the driving of the car, will notice all the stoplights, the other idiots on the road, and so on, and you will get there safely without even thinking about it.

> Dr. Watts said that definable objects and events do not exist in nature; they exist only because men have arbitrarily agreed on certain labels for convenience's sake. Labels are used to impose an order on nature that doesn't in fact exist, but is needed in order to understand the universe.   
   
When we live in a framework of labels, we use a type of awareness tb Dr. Watts called **"spotlight consciousness"** as opposed to a second kind of perception, **"floodlight consciousness."** Spotlight consciousness takes the form of words, numbers and concepts that we use to notate the things that interest us. Dr. Watts used calculus as an example to illustrate his point. In calculus, we use straight geometric lines to represent a non-straight line, but the two are not the same in nature, in both senses of the word. It is extremely important to remember that the reduction is not

> She compares “the lantern consciousness of childhood … to the spotlight consciousness of ordinary adult attention.” With lantern consciousness you are vividly aware of everything without being focused on any one thing in particular. There is a kind of exaltation and a peculiar kind of happiness that goes with these experiences too. — via [A-MUSED - LANTERN CONSCIOUSNESS & SPOTLIGHT CONSCIOUSNESS ...](https://www.philipchircop.com/post/36584675933/lantern-consciousness-spotlight-consciousness)
