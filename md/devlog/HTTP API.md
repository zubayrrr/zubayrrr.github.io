An HTTP API is an API that uses Hypertext Transfer Protocol as the communication protocol between the two systems. HTTP APIs expose endpoints as API gateways for HTTP requests to have access to a server.   
   
They provide one way communication - request/response model. They receive a request from a client and forward it to a backend resources. It also forwards response from backend to client.
