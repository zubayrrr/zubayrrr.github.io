> I met a traveller from an antique land,     
> Who said—“Two vast and trunkless legs of stone     
> Stand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand,     
> Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,     
> And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,     
> Tell that its sculptor well those passions read     
> Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,     
> The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;     
> And on the pedestal, these words appear:     
> My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;     
> Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!     
> Nothing beside remains. Round the decay     
> Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare     
> The lone and level sands stretch far away.”
