## Notes   
   
   
- Have a notebook with/on you at all time.   
- Take note of any observations you have any interesting thoughts you have.   
- Jot down your favourite passages from the books you're reading,   
- A lot of artists like David Hockney, Arther Russell had this habit of carrying a notebook with them wherever they went.   
- Steal from wherever and whenever you want, keep a [Swipe File](#Swipe%20File) with you to swipe ideas, quotes, thoughts, conversations from other peoeple, its like a scrapbook for ideas, cut, copy, paste things into it or maybe just use your camera.   
- Newspaper reporters like to call a "[Swipe File](#Swipe%20File)" as a "Morgue File" because thats where you keep dead notes/things so you can reanimate them for later use.
