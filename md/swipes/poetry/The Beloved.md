Mortal never won to view thee,     
Yet a thousand lovers woo thee;     
Not a nightingale but knows     
In the rose-bud sleeps the rose.     
     
[Love](../../topics/love.md) is where the glory falls     
Of thy face: on convent walls     
Or on tavern floors the same     
Unextinguishable flame.     
     
Where the turban'd anchorite     
Chanteth Allah day and night,     
Church-bells ring the call to prayer,     
And the Cross of Christ is there.   
   
â€” Hafez Shirazi
