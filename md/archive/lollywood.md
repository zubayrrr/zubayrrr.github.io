> Lollywood (in Punjabi, Urdu: لالی وُڈ‎ lâli vuḍ) is a film industry in Pakistan which consists of two separate film industries, the Urdu film industry and Punjabi-language film industry of Pakistani cinema. Lollywood is a combined term for both Urdu and Punjabi cinema because since 1947, Lahore has been the center of Pakistani cinema, producing films in both languages. In 1971 after the independence of Bangladesh it was fully shifted to Lahore. Since 2007, however, Karachi has largely overtaken Lahore in Urdu film productions. The word "Lollywood", a portmanteau of "Lahore" and "Hollywood", was coined in the summer of 1989 in Glamour magazine, published from Karachi, by gossip columnist Saleem Nasir.—via [Lollywood - Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lollywood)
