The **Arameans** (Old Aramaic: 𐤀𐤓𐤌𐤉𐤀; Greek: Ἀραμαῖοι; Syriac: ܐܪ̈ܡܝܐ / Ārāmāyē) were an ancient Semitic-speaking people in the Near East, first recorded in historical sources from the late 12th century BCE. The Aramean homeland was known as the land of Aram, encompassing central regions of modern Syria. At the beginning of the 1st millennium BCE, a number of Aramean states were established throughout the western regions of the ancient Near East. The most notable among them was the Kingdom of Aram-Damascus, that reached its height in the second half of the 9th century BCE, during the reign of king Hazael. A distinctive Aramaic alphabet was also developed and used for writing in the Old Aramaic language.During the 8th century BCE, local Aramean kingdoms were gradually conquered by the Neo-Assyrian Empire. Policy of population displacement and relocation, that was applied throughout Assyrian domains, also affected Arameans, many of whom were resettled by Assyrian authorities. As a result of a wider dispersion of Aramean communities throughout various regions of the Near East, the speaking area of Aramaic language was also widened, gradually gaining significance and eventually becoming the common language of public life and administration, particularly during the periods of Neo-Babylonian Empire (612–539), and later Achaemenid Empire (539–330). As a result of linguistic aramization, a wider Aramaic-speaking area was created throughout the central regions of the Near East, exceeding the boundaries of Aramean ethnic communities. During the later Hellenistic and Roman periods, minor Aramean states emerged, most notable of them being the Kingdom of Osroene, centered in Edessa, the birthplace of Edessan Aramaic, that later came to be known as Classical Syriac language.From the 1st century CE onward, the process of Christianization was initiated throughout the ancient Near East, encompassing various Aramaic-speaking communities, including Arameans, thus resulting in the creation of Aramean Christianity, represented by prominent Christian leaders and authors, who created their theological and literary works in Aramaic language, most notable of them being saint Ephrem of Edessa (d. 373). In the following period, two consecutive processes have affected Christian Arameans. First process was initiated during the 5th century, when ancient Greek custom of using Syrian/Syriac labels for Arameans and their language, started to gain acceptance among Aramean literary and ecclesiastical elites. Second process was initiated after the Arab conquest in the 7th century, that was followed by Islamization and gradual Arabization of Aramean communities throughout the Near East, ultimately resulting in their fragmentation and acculturation. Remaining communities of Christian Arameans continued to decline throughout the medieval period, divided internally along denominational lines, with majority adhering to Oriental Orthodoxy and thus belonging to the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the Oriental Orthodox Patriarchate of Antioch, that later came to be known as the Syriac Orthodox Church.During the Early Modern period, studies of Aramaic languages (both ancient and modern) were initiated among western scholars, thus leading to the formation of Aramaic studies as a wider multidisciplinary field, that also includes the study of cultural and historical heritage of Arameans. Linguistic and historical aspects of Aramean studies were widened, since the 19th century, by archaeological excavations of ancient Aramean sites in various regions of the Near East.
