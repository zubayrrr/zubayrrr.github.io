Datura is the scientific name for a genus containing 9-12 species of flowering plants in the nightshade family, which have been used in magic or religious ritual in various places around the world for millennia. However, every part of this plant is toxic, and it leads to numerous unintentional poisoning deaths every year. Unfortunately, because this plant does lead to hallucinations and intoxication, it is also abused as a recreational drug – a practice that has led to overdose deaths.   
   
Datura plants, also called Jimson weed or thornapples, are typically cultivated in modern times as a common garden plant due to their beautiful flowers. These plants are sometimes confused with Brugmansia plants, which are ornamental flowering plants sometimes called angel’s trumpets. The flowers on many Datura species are also trumpet-shaped, and they may be pink, white, yellow, or purple. When the flowering season is over, Datura produces capsule fruits covered in spines, thus the name thornapple. They have ornamental leaves, as well, and grow well in many temperate climates.   
   
All parts of Datura plants contain alkaloids, like scopolamine, hyoscyamine, and atropine. D. stramonium is one of the more common Datura plants in the United States that is abused for recreational reasons. Hallucinations from consuming Datura can last for two days, and the side effects can range from uncomfortable to dangerous.   
   
Abusing Datura recreationally became popular in the 1990s and early 2000s, leading to an increase in reports of overdose and poisoning death. The chemicals found in most Datura species can cause uncomfortable side effects, hallucinations, unusual behavior, mood disorders, and overdose. — via [What is Datura? & What Are the Effects ? | Sunrise House](https://sunrisehouse.com/herbal-drugs/datura/)
