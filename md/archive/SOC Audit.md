A SOC (System and Organization Controls) audit is an independent assessment of a company's internal controls, policies, and procedures. The purpose of a SOC audit is to evaluate the effectiveness of a company's internal controls and to provide assurance to stakeholders that the company's systems and processes are operating as intended. A SOC audit typically focuses on a company's financial reporting processes, but it can also cover other areas, such as IT controls, data security, and compliance with regulations. The results of a SOC audit are often used by organizations to improve their internal controls and to provide assurance to investors and other stakeholders that their systems and processes are operating effectively.
