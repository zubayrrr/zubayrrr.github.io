Azure Functions is a serverless compute service provided by Microsoft Azure. It allows users to run small, independent pieces of code, called "functions," in the cloud without having to worry about managing the underlying infrastructure. This makes it a convenient and scalable way to run code in response to events or on a schedule.   
   
Azure Functions allows users to write code in a variety of languages, such as C#, F#, [JavaScript](/not_created.md), and [Python](/not_created.md), and to run that code in response to events such as changes to data in Azure Storage, the arrival of new messages in [Azure Queue Storage](/not_created.md), or the execution of a schedule. This makes it a powerful and flexible platform for building event-driven and reactive applications.   
   
Azure Functions integrates with other Azure services, such as [Azure Storage](../devlog/Azure%20Storage.md), [Azure Cosmos DB](/not_created.md), and [Azure Event Hubs](/not_created.md), allowing users to easily access and manage their functions. It also provides built-in scalability and fault tolerance, ensuring that functions are able to handle a large volume of requests without interruption.   
   
Azure Functions is often used for tasks such as processing data, integrating with external services, and building [microservices](../devlog/microservices.md). It is a cost-effective and scalable way to run code in the cloud, and can be a useful tool for a wide range of applications.
