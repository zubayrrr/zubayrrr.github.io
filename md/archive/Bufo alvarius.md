The Colorado River Toad (also known as Bufo alvarius) has a mostly smooth and shiny, olive-green complexion. Though not wart-free, its most notable characteristic may be the toxic, milky-white venom it secretes to poison predators—the indigenous raccoons, birds, and other critters found in the Sonoran Desert region that includes parts of California, Arizona, and northern Mexico. Anthropologists have long surmised that toad venom was used in ancient rituals for its intoxicating effect.   
   
The substance derived from that venom (and also found in some psychoactive plants) is 5-MeO-DMT, an extremely potent psychedelic that is four to six times stronger than its better-known relative DMT (or dimethyltryptamine). It’s also a Schedule I drug making it illegal to manufacture, distribute, possess, or buy (in Mexico it isn’t regulated).   
   
Bufo is smoked directly in a pipe or vape and quickly goes into and out of the bloodstream. The medicine is collected when the Bufo alvarius toad comes out of hibernation—its poison-secreting gland is milked, the venom is collected and dried. It then turns to a powdery crystal that can be smoked. The synthetic version is smoked differently.   
   
Bufo’s hallucinogenic effects take hold very quickly—within minutes—after ingestion and last anywhere from 20 minutes to an hour. People who have taken Bufo often describe their experience as being one with the universe and feeling reborn. Some describe a fusion with God, a visceral connection with the divine source. Others experience colors, looping patterns, and a sense of connection with the universe/all beings.
