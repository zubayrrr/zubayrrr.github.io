title: Why Do Goats Poop Pellets

That's very interesting to know that goats have large rumen as well as reticulum in proportion to their body weight. Whatever they eat, it is completely digested after a period of about 3 days. Goats have high metabolic rate which requires lot of energy. This energy comes from the roughage which is 3-7% of their body weight. After rumination, the digesta enters into omasum where most of the water is absorbed. In the abomasum, it is further digested into smaller particles and mixed with enzymatic secretions. Its intestine is very long where the movement of digesta is very very slow which is mainly comprised of segmentation and peristalsis. The segmentation virtually squeezes out all the water and nutrients, so that the excreted material is reduced in the form of small balls or pellets! Moreover, goats economize the use of water like camels, so that a very little water is lost by goats through feces. [^1]
