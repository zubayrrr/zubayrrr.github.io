Bioassay is a biochemical test that calculates the relative potency of a sample compound to a standard compound. By definition, a bioassay is the “determination of the relative strength of a substance (as a drug) by comparing its effect on a test organism with that of a standard preparation.” Bioassays are used to measure the biological activity and effects of a substance, like a hormone or drug, on a living organism such as a living plant (in vivo) or tissue or cell (in vitro).
