After successfully [Test the Theory](../devlog/test%20the%20theory.md), establish a plan of action to fix the problem.   
   
   
- Determine how to roll out the fix (if it is applicable on a larger scale).   
- Backup data and configurations before deploying the fix.   
- In case of inability to execute plan, escalate (they might have to use centralized device management tool, eg: Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager or [SCCM](/not_created.md))   
   
Determine solution scope   
   
   
- Is it going to be applied to only one device (user)   
- Type of devices   
- Server   
- Network devices   
   
Plan the solution implementation   
   
Put the solution into motion   
   
   
- Backup affected system first (data and config)
