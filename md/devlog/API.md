Application Programming Interface.   
   
It is essentially a software intermediary that allows two applications or an application and a server to communicate.   
   
APIs operate as a bridge between applications, allowing them to communicate more efficiently. APIs can be categorized into various types based on application designs and other constraints, such as Web API, [HTTP API](../devlog/HTTP%20API.md), [REST API](../devlog/REST%20API.md), [WebSockets API](../devlog/WebSockets%20API.md) and many more.
