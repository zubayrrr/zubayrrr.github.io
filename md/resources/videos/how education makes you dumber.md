> Children should be kept from all kinds of instructions that may make errors possible until their sixteenth year, that is to say, from philosophy, religion, and general views of every description; because it is the errors that are acquired in early days that remain, as a rule, ineradicable, and because the faculty of judgment is the last to arrive at maturity. — Schopenhauer, On Education   
   
Observation(Experience) —> Learning   
   
   
- Schopenhauer says that humans in their natural state learn from their observations/experience, the observation precedes learning, learning doesn't happen before experience.   
- When learning happens in this way, there is a clear link between the idea and the experience (or the application of the idea).   
- Schopenhauer calls traditional education as "Artificail education" in which the idea preceds experience.   
   
> ...artifical education is having one's head crammed full of idea, derived from hearing others talk, from learning and reading, before one has anything like an extensive knowledge of the world as it is and as one sees it.   
   
   
- The problem with this approach is that when you try to apply an idea before you have the necessary experience, you apply the idea wrongly. Schopenhauer calls this as "perversion".   
   
> And so it is that education perverts the mind; and this is why, after a long spell of learning and reading, we enter the world, in our youth, with view that are partly simple, partly perverted...This is because our head is full of ideas which we're now trying to make use of, but almost always apply wrongly.   
   
   
- The teacher is busy trying to cram ideas inside the children's mind instead of teaching them how to think in the first place; this causes children to grow up with ideas they learned from hearsay and opinions and are left unarmed to deal with situations in the real world(out of the textbook).   
- The children are submerged in a web of ideas based on opinions and prejudice; they grow up to find this conflicting with the real world, they face a cognitive dissonance and due to them never being taught how to change their opinions in the light of new evidence or facts they lash out against the world or the idea of it that was created for them in childhood.   
   
> He has never attempted to abstract fundamental ideas from his own observations and experience, because he has got everything ready-made from other people; and it is for this very reason that he and countless others are so insipid and shallow.   
   
   
- Even if they're taught objectively correct things, they don't fully understand why they're so.   
- Schopenhauer puts a lot of importance in teaching children words and making sure they understand what those words really mean.   
   
> ...One must next take care that children do not use words with which they connect no clear meaning. Even children have, as a rule, that unhappy tendency of being satisfied with words instead of wishing to understand things, and of learning words by heart, so that they may make use of them when they're in a difficulty. This tendency clings to them afterwards, so that the knowledge of many learned men becomes mere verbosity.   
   
   
- Schopenhauer also proposes that before the age of sixteen children should only be taught things and subjects in which objective errors are possible(eg: Maths and Linguistics) and they shouldn't be taught things in which objective errors are not possible, matters of opinions, religion, philosophy et cetera.   
- Schopenhauer says this because he believes before the age of sixteen the faculty of judgement is not fully developed in a human, which makes it hard for him to make opinions of his own about matters as intricate as religion and philosophy thus he is also easily influenced if a ready-made answer is given to him.   
- Schopenhauer believes history must be taught but only stuff like dates and names of places and people...the added benefit of this is that since our memory is sharpest in our youth it behooves that we prioritize learning those things. He should soak up as much useful information as possible making good use of his youthful memory.   
- Schopenhauer believes that maturity should come with experience.   
- Its really important for us to interact/engage with the real world(when he says "engage", I think he means that we should try to apply our ideas to the real world).   
   
> Instead, therefore, of hastening to place mere books in their hands, one should make them gradually acquainted with things and the circumstances of human life, and above everything one should take care to guide them to a clear grasp of reality, and to teach them to obtain their ideas directly from the real world, and to form them in keeping with it— but not to get them from elsewhere, as from books, fables, or what others have said...   
   
   
- Those who learn everything from books lack common sense, we can go as far as to say that traditional education kills common sense.   
   
> This why so few men of learning have such sound common sense as is quite common among the illiterate.   
   
   
- Children should spend time learning and knowing the real world, the sciences that govern the real world instead of spending time knowing books.
