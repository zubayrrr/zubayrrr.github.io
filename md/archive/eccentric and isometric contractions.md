In bodybuilding, the terms "eccentric" and "isometric" refer to different types of muscle contractions.   
   
An eccentric contraction occurs when a muscle lengthens while it is contracting. This type of contraction can occur when a muscle is being used to resist a force that is trying to stretch it. For example, when you lower a weight during a bicep curl, your bicep muscle is performing an eccentric contraction. Eccentric contractions can also be used to control the speed at which a movement is performed, such as when you lower yourself slowly during a squat.   
   
An isometric contraction, on the other hand, occurs when a muscle contracts without changing length. This type of contraction can occur when a muscle is being used to resist a force that is trying to move it, but the force is not strong enough to cause the muscle to move. For example, if you push against a stationary object with your hand, your arm muscles will contract isometrically.   
   
## Negatives   
   
In bodybuilding, "negatives" refer to the eccentric portion of a lift, or the lowering phase of a movement. For example, when you perform a bicep curl, the concentric portion of the lift is when you curl the weight up towards your shoulder, and the eccentric portion is when you lower the weight back down. Negatives, or the eccentric portion of a lift, can be emphasized in a workout to increase muscle strength and size.   
   
There are a few different ways to incorporate negatives into a bodybuilding routine:   
   
1.  Slow negatives: Perform the eccentric portion of a lift slowly, taking at least 2-3 seconds to lower the weight. This can help to increase muscle strength and size by creating more time under tension for the muscle.   
2.  Forced negatives: Have a spotter help you lift a weight that is heavier than you can normally lift on your own, and then lower the weight slowly using just your own strength. This can help to increase muscle strength and size by forcing the muscle to work harder during the eccentric portion of the lift.   
3.  Negative-only sets: Perform a set of an exercise using only the eccentric portion of the lift. For example, have a spotter help you lift a weight during a bicep curl, and then lower the weight slowly using just your own strength. This can help to increase muscle strength and size by focusing solely on the eccentric portion of the lift.   
     
   
It's important to note that negatives can be more demanding on the muscles and joints than concentric movements, so it's important to use proper form and start with lighter weights when incorporating negatives into your routine.
