Motherboards are circuit boards within a computer, be it a laptop or a desktop, also referred to as "mobos".   
   
   
- It is the primary digital circuit board in a computer   
- Allows internal component and external peripheral connections   
   
#### Motherboard form factor   
   
   
- Size   
- Orientation within the case   
- Common form factors incclude: ATX, mATX, ITX, mITX   
- Connectors/Slots: Mutliple [CPU](../devlog/cpu.md) sockets(in high-end systems), \# of PCI Express slots, \# of [USB](../devlog/usb.md) ports.   
   
#### BIOS   
   
Newer version of BIOS is [uefi](../devlog/uefi.md)   
   
BIOS is the firmware on the [Motherboard](../devlog/motherboard.md), firmware instruction set of a motherboard, it can be upgraded, it is burned into the chip of the motherboard.   
   
We can configure things such as:   
   
   
- Power on password   
- Driver encryption   
- Secure boot(that makes sure OS hasn't been tampered with) Secure boot is specific to [uefi](../devlog/uefi.md)   
   
#### CMOS   
   
CMOS is really our configuration of [bios](../devlog/bios.md)/[uefi](../devlog/uefi.md) possible settings.   
   
CMOS is not firmware instruction like BIOS but our configuration of it.   
   
CMOS Battery makes sure our BIOS settings are retained even if our machine is powered off for long periods of time.
