A twelve-step program is a set of guiding principles outlining a course of action for recovery from addiction, compulsions, or other behavioral problems. The concept was originally developed by Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and has since been adapted for various other purposes, such as Narcotics Anonymous (NA) and Gamblers Anonymous (GA). The twelve steps are a series of guiding principles that outline a course of action for recovery from addiction and other behavioral problems. The twelve steps are:   
   
1.  We admitted we were powerless over our addiction and that our lives had become unmanageable.   
2.  We came to believe that a power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity.   
3.  We made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of God as we understood Him.   
4.  We made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves.   
5.  We admitted to God, to ourselves, and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs.   
6.  We were entirely ready to have God remove all these defects of character.   
7.  We humbly asked Him to remove our shortcomings.   
8.  We made a list of all persons we had harmed, and became willing to make amends to them all.   
9.  We made direct amends to such people wherever possible, except when to do so would injure them or others.   
10.  We continued to take personal inventory and when we were wrong promptly admitted it.   
11.  We sought through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious contact with God as we understood Him, praying only for knowledge of His will for us and the power to carry that out.   
12.  Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these steps, we tried to carry this message to others and to practice these principles in all our affairs.   
   
The twelve-step program is based on the idea of surrendering one's ego and defects of character to a higher power and relying on that power to restore sanity. The program is designed to be worked through in a series of steps, with the ultimate goal of achieving spiritual growth and a more fulfilling life.
