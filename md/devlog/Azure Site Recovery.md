Azure Site Recovery (ASR) is a cloud-based disaster recovery service provided by Microsoft Azure. It helps organizations to protect their workloads and data in the event of a disaster, such as a natural disaster, hardware failure, or network outage, by providing a comprehensive solution for replicating and recovering workloads and data in Azure.   
   
ASR provides a range of features and capabilities, such as replication, failover, and testing, to help organizations to design and implement a disaster recovery plan that meets their specific requirements and needs. It integrates with other Azure services, such as [Azure Backup](/not_created.md) and [Azure Monitor](../devlog/Azure%20Monitor.md), to provide a complete disaster recovery solution for Azure workloads.
