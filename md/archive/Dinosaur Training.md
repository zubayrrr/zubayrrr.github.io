**Dinosaur Training** is a philosophy of weight training / physical culture promoting a return to traditional strongman types of exercises and training.   
   
Dinosaur training positions itself in opposition to [aerobics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerobics "Aerobics") exercise culture and to [bodybuilding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodybuilding "Bodybuilding") and other training methods geared towards cosmetic purposes. It stresses intensity, hard work, functional strength, power, endurance and mental toughness.   
   
Dinosaur training methodologies have been disseminated through the training manuals written by Brooks D. Kubik, although Bob Whelan, Ken Leistner, and [John McCallum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCallum_(author) "John McCallum (author)") are counted as proponents of similar training methods. Historical lifters like [Peary Rader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peary_Rader "Peary Rader") and various late 19th-century and early 20th-century [strongmen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strongman_(strength_athlete) "Strongman (strength athlete)") and [physical culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_culture "Physical culture") proponents such as [Eugen Sandow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugen_Sandow "Eugen Sandow") are regarded as being inspiration of dinosaur training styles.   
   
Kubik's book _Dinosaur Training_ became highly acclaimed by the weight-lifting community. It offered simple yet effective routines, which were in stark contrast to complex routines offered by many authors within the fitness industry. Kubiks books are written in a motivational style, with an edge of humour.   
   
For a time Kubik advocated Dinosaur Training using bodyweight exercises, as described in his book Dinosaur Bodyweight Training (2006), using such exercises as pushups, handstand pushups, pullups, neck bridges, hanging leg raises, and two- and one-legged deep knee bends. In recent years however he has returned to writing about and advocating traditional weightlifting modes of training, using such exercises as squats, deadlifts, powercleans, high pulls, military presses, barbell bentover rows, benchpresses, etc. for low to moderate reps.
