AWS allows customers to assign metadata to their AWS resources in the form of tags. Each tag is a simple label consisting of a customer-defined key and an optional value that can make it easier to manage, search for, and filter resources. AWS Cost Explorer and detailed billing reports support the ability to break down AWS costs by tag.
