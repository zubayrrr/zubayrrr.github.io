This is a blinkist summary of A Handbook for New Stoics   
   
   
- For those who desire a life of virtue and serenity.   
- It prioritizes reason and logic to navigate through different social situations.   
- Nobody wants to be unhappy and stoicism offers one of the best bets for happiness.   
- It can be traced back to 300 BCE.   
- Stoicism's usage can be found in modern psychiatric practices such as [CBT](/not_created.md)   
   
### Focusing on things that are truly under our control   
   
   
- Is one of the tenets of stoicism.   
- Often our sources of unhappiness are things that are really out of our control.   
- What if we can learn to let go of our desires for goals that are unreliable, what if our happiness didn't depend on money and opinions of others.   
   
### There are three key areas to focus on Ethics, Physics and Logic   
   
   
- Ethics is about finding an ideal way to live.   
- Having an understand of physics   
  - How nature and humans work   
- Most humans have capacity to reason and logic.   
- Stoics believe that the key to a peaceful existence is to live according to nature(extending: human nature).   
  - Understanding the common habits and tendencies that can stand in our way of well-being.   
   
### 9 exercises divided into 3 categories   
   
   
- **Discipline of desire, action, ascent** - make up 3 discipline practice of stoicism.   
- Practice of stoicism is threefolds - beginning with Discipline of desire.   
- All three disciplines are centered around dichotomy of control.   
   
#### Dichotomy of control   
   
   
- Identifying what is within and not within our control (first exercise).   
- Serenity prayer:   
   
> God, grant me the serenity   
>   
> to accept the things I cannot change,   
>   
> the courage to change the things I can,   
>   
> and the wisdom to know the difference.   
   
   
- [epictetus](../../resources/people/epictetus.md) Suggests we only have three things under our complete control.   
  - Thought - more precisely, Judgement   
  - Impulse   
  - Will to avoid or to get   
- Epictetus isn't suggesting that we can control which thoughts enter our minds or which impulses occur.   
  - He was really suggesting what judgments our thoughts can carry and whether or not we decide to act on our impulses.   
    - For example: we can control when the impulse/desire for hunger arises but we can control whether or not we should eat.   
  - Likewise, we have the power to accept or reject a thought.   
   
#### When paying attention to what's in your control focus on Character   
   
   
- Discipline of desire is to avoid or control the desires that do not contribute to good character.   
- Ultimately, the thing on which we do have complete control is our character.   
  - Our character is sum of our decisions and actions.   
  - We can control our urges and desires and we can make decisions based on sound reasoning and our own set of values and ideals.   
- Second exercises is about Shifting focus from external to internal things.   
  - For example deciding how we use our time and other decision making.   
- Instead of worrying about the outcome, telling yourself that you did everything in your control to influence(making good decisions) a positive outcome and choose to be happy regardless of the outcome.   
   
#### Impermanence of life, possessions and circumstances   
   
   
- Nothing lasts forever - this applies for most problems in your life.   
- Stoics value [[equanimity](/not_created.md) and not as it's critics suggests i.e a cold, callous, uncaring attitude.   
- Bad things are bound to happen in life, there is no guarantee; in such circumstances we should rely on equanimity and remind ourselves of the impermanence of life, possessions and circumstances.   
- "[This too shall pass](../../swipes/phrases/this%20too%20shall%20pass.md)" - is what I like to think of.   
- And also remind yourself of the good days(expressing gratitude).   
   
#### Preparing yourself for what is likely to happen   
   
   
- Actions you take or don't take.   
- Responding to adversity with virtues actions.   
- It is easier said than done but practicing it makes it easier.   
- Familiarize/Understand your environment.   
- Knowing ahead of time the challenges you'll expect when entering into a given situation.   
- Prepare yourself to what is likely to happen so you're not caught off guard(lessens your chances of losing your zen mode and acting in a way you may later regret).
