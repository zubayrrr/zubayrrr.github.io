Ferrocerium (also known in Europe as Auermetall) is a synthetic pyrophoric alloy of "mischmetal" (cerium, lanthanum, neodymium, other trace lanthanides and some iron â€“ about 95% lanthanides and 5% iron) hardened by blending in oxides of iron and / or magnesium.   
   
Ferro rods and flint rocks spark when struck against steel, Ferrocerium is often called flint or artificial flint.
