Traceroute, also called `tracert`, is a utility that uses ICMP packets to record the route through the internet from one computer to another. It calculates the time taken for each hop as the packet is routed to the destination. To guarantee accuracy, each hop is queried multiple times (in this case four times) to better measure the response of that particular hop.â€”via [Traceroute Test - Simultaneously Trace From 10 Global Locations,KeyCDN Tools](https://tools.keycdn.com/traceroute)
