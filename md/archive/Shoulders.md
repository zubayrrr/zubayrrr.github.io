## Exercises   
   
   
- Band face pulls beats lateral raises - AlphaDestiny   
- Rear delts are extremely important   
- Doing rows with arms out wider(45 degrees)   
   
Flared arms = more rhomboids and traps   
Fully tucked neutral position = Lats   
45 degree between the other two positions = delts   
   
Buy a chest expander    
   
Bench press and specific rows = more shoulders
