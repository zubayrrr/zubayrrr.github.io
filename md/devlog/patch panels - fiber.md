updated: 1652622339014

- Connect fiber jacks throughout building to a single patch panel in network closet.   
- Unlike [Patch Panels - Copper](../devlog/patch%20panels%20-%20copper.md) there are no [Punch Down Blocks](../devlog/punch%20down%20blocks.md), instead we'd have LC Connectors or ST, SC.
