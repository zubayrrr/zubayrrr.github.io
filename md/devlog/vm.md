> Virtualization is a process whereby software is used to create an abstraction layer over computer hardware that allows the hardware elements of a single computer to be divided into multiple virtual computers.   
   
The software used is called a hypervisor — a small layer that enables multiple operating systems to run alongside each other, sharing the same physical computing resources. When a hypervisor is used on a physical computer or server (also known as bare metal server) in a data center, it allows the physical computer to separate its operating system and applications from its hardware. Then, it can divide itself into several independent “virtual machines.” — via [Containers vs. Virtual Machines (VMs): What’s the Difference? | IBM](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/containers-vs-vms)   
   
 Virtualization technology allows multiple operating systems and software applications to run simultaneously and share the resources of a single physical computer. For example, an IT organization can run both Windows and [linux](../topics/linux.md) or multiple versions of an operating system, along with multiple applications on the same server. Each application and its related files, libraries, and dependencies, including a copy of the operating system (OS), are packaged together as a VM. With multiple VMs running on a single physical machine, it’s possible to achieve significant savings in capital, operational, and energy costs.
