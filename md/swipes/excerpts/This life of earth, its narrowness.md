Faust: This life of earth, its narrowness,   
Pains me, however I’m turned out,   
I’m too old to play about,   
Too young, still, to be passionless.   
What can the world bring me again?   
Abstain! You shall! You must! Abstain!   
That’s the eternal song   
That in our ears, forever, rings   
The one, that, our whole life long,   
Every hour, hoarsely, sings.   
I wake in terror with the dawn,   
I cry, the bitterest tears, to see   
Day grant no wish of mine, not one   
As it passes by on its journey.   
Even presentiments of joy   
Ebb, in wilful depreciation:   
A thousand grimaces life employs   
To hinder me in creation.   
Then when night descends I must   
Stretch out, worried, on my bed:   
What comes to me is never rest,   
But some wild dream instead.   
The God that lives inside my heart,   
Can rouse my innermost seeing:   
The one enthroned beyond my art,   
Can’t stir external being:   
And so existence is a burden: sated,   
Death’s desired, and Life is hated.
