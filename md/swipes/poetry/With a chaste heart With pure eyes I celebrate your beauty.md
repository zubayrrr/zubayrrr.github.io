“With a chaste heart   
With pure eyes I celebrate your beauty   
Holding the leash of blood   
So that it might leap out and trace your outline   
Where you lie down in my Ode   
As in a land of forests or in surf   
In aromatic loam, or in sea music   
   
Beautiful nude   
Equally beautiful your feet   
Arched by primeval tap of wind or sound   
Your ears, small shells   
Of the splendid American sea   
Your breasts of level plentitude   
Fulfilled by living light   
Your flying eyelids of wheat   
Revealing or enclosing   
The two deep countries of your eyes   
   
The line your shoulders have divided into pale regions   
Loses itself and blends into the compact halves of an apple   
Continues separating your beauty down into two columns of   
Burnished gold   
Fine alabaster   
To sink into the two grapes of your feet   
Where your twin symmetrical tree burns again and rises   
Flowering fire   
Open chandelier   
A swelling fruit   
Over the pact of sea and earth   
   
From what materials   
Agate?   
Quartz?   
Wheat?   
Did your body come together?   
Swelling like baking bread to signal silvered hills   
The cleavage of one petal   
Sweet fruits of a deep velvet   
Until alone remained   
Astonished   
The fine and firm feminine form   
   
It is not only light that falls over the world spreading inside your body   
Yet suffocate itself   
So much is clarity   
Taking its leave of you   
As if you were on fire within   
   
The moon lives in the lining of your skin.”   
   
― Pablo Neruda
