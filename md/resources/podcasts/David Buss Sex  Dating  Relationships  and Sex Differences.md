- Women go for good genes in the short term and for resources in the long term   
  - Women tend to prefer men who are physically fit   
  - symmetrical features   
  - masculine features(strong jawline, high shoulder to hip ratio)   
    - Shoulders should be wide relative to hips   
  - Well toned but not muscle bound   
  - Taller(above average, an inch or two)   
  - Women may interpret guys who are obsessed about their body with narcissism   
- Short term mating for women is not “one night stand”, its more affair mating.   
- Why do women have affairs?   
  - One theory suggests that they’re trying to get good genes from one partner and resources from the other.   
- When women have affairs, 70% of the time they get attached to their partner in crime   
  - But men only 30% of the time   
- Mating switching hypothesis   
  - affairs are one way women diversify themselves   
  - to transition into the mating market or to trade up   
- We’ve adaptations to switch mates for various (survival) reasons   
- In some cultures, a man’s hunting ability(resources) gives them high status   
  - In modern cultures on the other hand; cash economies are relatively recent, in the old times you weren’t able to stockpile resources.   
  - [steve pinker](../../resources/people/steve%20pinker.md) said that you're storing meat in other people   
    - by which he means that if you provide for them (say, from your hunt) they'll reciprocate by providing for you
