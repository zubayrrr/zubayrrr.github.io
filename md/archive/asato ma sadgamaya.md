These three statements are referred to as the three Pavamana Mantras. Some renderings — generally modern — add ॐ (oṃ) at the beginning and/or ॐ शान्तिः शान्तिः शान्तिः ॥ (oṃ śāntiḥ śāntiḥ śāntiḥ, 'om peace peace peace') as a fourth line. This is a stylistic addition that concludes a recitation; as such it is often included with the verse. The Upanishad itself does not end the line that way — via [Pavamana Mantra - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pavamana_Mantra)
