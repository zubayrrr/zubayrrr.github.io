Kambo is a traditional healing ritual performed in many South American countries.   
   
A shaman healer performs the ceremony, which involves burning the personâ€™s shoulder, leg, or foot, and then applying a kambo secretion to the wound. These burns may leave scars.   
   
Kambo is a poisonous substance that the giant monkey frog secretes. People sometimes refer to this animal as the giant leaf frog. Its scientific name is Phyllomedusa bicolor.   
   
The giant monkey frog is native to the Amazon rainforest. They reside in parts of Brazil, Peru, and Venezuela. People in many cultures revere giant monkey frogs for their alleged healing abilities.   
   
Many indigenous tribes and urban populations use the cleanse for a number of reasons. Traditionally, hunters would participate in the ritual to heighten their senses and stamina before a hunt.   
   
Kambo is a poison. For this reason, it could cause vomiting, sweating, and a rapid heart rate. There have also been reported cases of death following a cleanse. Even applying it topically can cause death, as the skin absorbs the toxins.   
   
Because giant monkey frogs are nocturnal, they are only active at night, which makes it difficult to collect kambo. However, they have a distinct call, which shamans use to locate their nests.   
   
After capturing a giant monkey frog, a shaman collects the waxy secretions, or kambo, from its legs. They will carefully scrape the secretions onto wooden sticks and leave them to dry.   
   
Once the shaman has collected the kambo, they aim to release the frog, relatively unharmed, back into the forest.   
   
During the kambo ritual, a shaman will burn small holes into the top layers of the skin using the end of a burning stick. They will then apply a small amount of kambo to each burn. The shoulder is the typical location for kambo administration, but the practitioner may also apply it to the back, legs, or feet.   
   
Within minutes of applying the kambo, people tend to experience immediate and generally unpleasant symptoms, such as:   
   
   
- sweating   
- tachycardia, or a rapid heart rate   
- dizziness   
- nausea   
- vomiting   
- loss of bladder control   
- muscle contractions   
   
Many people report feeling a burning sensation throughout their bodies. Dizziness, nausea, and violent vomiting, which can last for several minutes, quickly follow the burning sensation.   
   
When the symptoms begin to decrease, a shaman may encourage the person to rehydrate by drinking water. Drinking water helps flush out toxins.   
   
Kambo is a poisonous substance that can cause severe health complications and even death if a person applies it incorrectly. The shaman will determine the dosage and placement of the kambo. The practitioner also oversees the ritual for safety.
