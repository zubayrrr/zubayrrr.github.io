> Sod's law, a British culture axiom, states that "if something can go wrong, it will". The law sometimes has a [corollary](/not_created.md): that the misfortune will happen at "the worst possible time". The term is commonly used in the United Kingdom, though in North America, the phrase "[Murphy's law](#Murphy's%20law)" is more popular.â€”via [sod's law - Google Search](https://www.google.com/search?q=sod%27s+law&oq=sod%27s+&aqs=chrome.0.0i512j69i57j0i10j0i10i433l4j46i10i433j0i10i433j46i10.2035j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)
