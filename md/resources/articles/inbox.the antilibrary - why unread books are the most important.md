## Notes   
   
   
- A library of unread books exists to serve us the reminder of what we do not know.   
- We underestimate the value of what we don't know and overvaluate what we do not know, we don't allow ourselves to be surprised nor do we understand the value of surprises.

> The writer Umberto Eco belongs to that small class of scholars who are encyclopedic, insightful, and nondull. He is the owner of a large personal library (containing thirty thousand books), and separates visitors into two categories: those who react with “Wow\! Signore professore dottore Eco, what a library you have. How many of these books have you read?” and the others—a very small minority—who get the point is that a private library is not an ego-boosting appendages but a research tool. \*\*The library should contain as much of what you do not know as your financial means … allow you to put there\*\*. You will accumulate more knowledge and more books as you grow older, and the growing number of unread books on the shelves will look at you menacingly. \*\*Indeed, the more you know, the larger the rows of unread books. Let us call this collection of unread books an antilibrary.\*\*
