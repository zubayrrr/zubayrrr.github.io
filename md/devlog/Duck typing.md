> **Duck typing** in computer programming is an application of the duck test—"If it walks like a duck and it quacks like a duck, then it must be a duck"—to determine whether an object can be used for a particular purpose. With nominative typing, an object is of a given type if it is declared to be (or if a type's association with the object is inferred through mechanisms such as object inheritance). In duck typing, an object is of a given type if it has all methods and properties required by that type. Duck typing can be viewed as a usage-based structural equivalence between a given object and the requirements of a type.  See structural typing for a further explanation of structural type equivalence.
