A metatheory or meta-theory is a theory whose subject matter is itself a theory. In mathematics and mathematical logic, a metatheory is a mathematical theory about another mathematical theory.Meta-theoretical investigations are part of the philosophy of science. A metatheory is not applied directly to practice, but may have applications to the practice of the field it studies.The emerging field of metascience seeks to use scientific knowledge to improve the practice of science itself.
