- There are a lot of networks and not just computer networks.   
- The purpose of these networks is to make connections between different machines.   
- Network between your personal devices such as a smart watch and a smart phone over [Bluetooth](../devlog/Bluetooth.md) is called a [PAN](../devlog/pan.md).   
- There is also the typical [Wi-Fi](../devlog/wi-fi.md) network when you're connected through the wireless access point that connects out to the internet.   
- Or it can also be your desktop connected to a [Hub](../devlog/hub.md) which is connected to a [Switch](../devlog/switch.md) that is connected to a Router and the [router](../devlog/router.md) ultimately connected to the internet.   
- All of these networks combined are known as Converged Network.   
- In the old days we had different networks for different purposes such as a Telephone Network to make Analog Phone Calls seperate from Computer Network for digital things.   
- Overtime this has merged and we now have all one network taking care of all things. (A digital network)   
- Uptime is really important for these networks and people expect the network to be up 100% of the time but thats unrealistic, sometime has to be sacrificed for maintainence and other things but most networks are guaranteed uptime for 99.999% of time time (The 5 nines of availability)   
- Throughout the course of the year 5 minutes of downtime allowed per year.   
- Network traffic can be:   
  - File sharing   
  - Video chatting   
  - Web surfing   
  - Social media   
  - Video streaming   
  - Email   
  - Messaging   
  - VoIP
