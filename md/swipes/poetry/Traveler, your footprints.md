## Traveler, your footprints   
   
Traveler, your footprints   
are the only road, nothing else.   
Traveler, there is no road;   
you make your own path as you walk.   
As you walk, you make your own road,   
and when you look back   
you see the path   
you will never travel again.   
Traveler, there is no road;   
only a ship's wake on the sea.   
   
â€” Antonio Machado
