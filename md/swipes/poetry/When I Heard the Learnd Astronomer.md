title: When I Heard the Learnd Astronomer
updated: 1661600759481

> When I heard the learn’d astronomer,     
> When the proofs, the figures, were ranged in columns before me,     
> When I was shown the charts and diagrams, to add, divide, and measure them,     
> When I sitting heard the astronomer where he lectured with much applause in the lecture-room,     
> How soon unaccountable I became tired and sick,     
> Till rising and gliding out I wander’d off by myself,     
> In the mystical moist night-air, and from time to time,     
> Look’d up in perfect silence at the stars.
