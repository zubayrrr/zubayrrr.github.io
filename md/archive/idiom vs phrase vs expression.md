A phrase is “a small group of words standing together as a conceptual unit”, while an idiom is “a group of words established by usage as having a meaning not deducible from those of the individual words”. So, the difference is that an idiom as an **established meaning not directly linked to the individual words.** Any idiom is a phrase.   
   
> As an example, “raining cats and dogs” is both an idiom and a phrase. “A herd of cats” is a phrase but not an idiom.   
   
_[Expression](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/expression)_ has about the same meaning as _phrase_, except it is usually used of a phrase which is in common use.   
   
So an _idiom_ is a certain sort of _expression_, which in turn is a subset of _phrase_: _idiom_ > _expression_ > _phrase_.
