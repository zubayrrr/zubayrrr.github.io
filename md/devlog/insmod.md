insmod command in Linux systems is used to insert modules into the kernel. Linux is an Operating System which allows the user to load kernel modules on run time to extend the kernel functionalities. LKMs(Loadable Kernel Modules) are usually used to add support for new hardware (as device drivers) and/or filesystems, or for adding system calls. This command here inserts the kernel object file (`.ko`) into the kernel with/without arguments, along with a few additional options.
