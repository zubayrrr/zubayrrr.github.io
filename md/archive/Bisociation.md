Bisociation is the simultaneous mental association of an idea or object with two fields ordinarily not regarded as related<sup class="text-zinc-500"><a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bisociation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[1]</a></sup><sup class="text-zinc-500"><a href="https://www.thefreedictionary.com/bisociation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[2]</a></sup><sup class="text-zinc-500"><a href="https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/bisociation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[3]</a></sup>. It calls for unconventional thinking that aims to remove common beliefs and repetitive thought processes<sup class="text-zinc-500"><a href="https://cio-wiki.org/wiki/Bisociation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[4]</a></sup>, and examples include linking one idea with two different contexts<sup class="text-zinc-500"><a href="https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/bisociation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[3]</a></sup> or connecting an idea with two separate fields<sup class="text-zinc-500"><a href="https://www.thefreedictionary.com/bisociation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[2]</a></sup>.   
   
The aim is to avoid alterations to existing ideas and to create transformations instead<sup class="text-zinc-500"><a href="https://cio-wiki.org/wiki/Bisociation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[3]</a></sup>.   
   
Bisociation is a term coined by the psychologist and writer Arthur Koestler to describe the process of combining seemingly unrelated or incompatible ideas, concepts, or experiences in a way that creates a new and novel perspective or understanding.According to Koestler, bisociation requires the ability to see connections and patterns between unrelated things, and to be open to the possibility of making connections that may not be immediately obvious.
