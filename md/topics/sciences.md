One of the cardinal rules of science is that whatever is being investigated must yield to he empirical test and be replicated. That is, the existence of something, be it a theory for example, must be verifiable or disprovable by repeated observation, measurement, and experimentation.   
   
Scientists don’t just say, “Take my word for it!” They say, “I’ll test it and if I’m right, okay. If I’m not, then we’ll make adjustments.”
