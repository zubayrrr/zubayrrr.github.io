## Sloww Hierarchy of Happiness – Transcendence   
   
What happens when life is no longer all about you?   
   
> ‘The self-transcendence of human existence’ ... being human always points, and is directed, to something, or someone, other than oneself—be it a meaning to fulfill or another human being to encounter. The more one forgets himself—by giving himself to a cause to serve or another person to love—the more human he is and the more he actualizes himself ... self-actualization is possible only as a side-effect of self-transcendence. — Viktor Frankl   
   
> There are three words that convey the secret of the art of living, the secret of all success and happiness: One With Life. Being one with life is being one with [Now](../topics/Now.md). You then realize that you don’t live your life, but life lives you. Life is the dancer, and you are the dance. — Eckhart Tolle   
   
> For unenlightened people, not every day is a good day, because they feel happy only when things happen the way they want them to. For enlightened people, every single day is a good day, because they feel free knowing that nothing can take away their wisdom. — Haemin Sunim   
   
> As you identify less and less with the ‘[I](../topics/self.md)’, you will be more at ease with everybody and with everything. Do you know why? Because you are no longer afraid of being hurt or not liked. You no longer desire to impress anyone. Can you imagine the relief when you don’t have to impress anybody anymore? Oh, what a relief. Happiness at last! — Anthony de Mello   
   
> What is called the world is only thought. When the world disappears, i.e., when there is no thought, the mind experiences happiness; and when the world appears, it goes through misery. — Ramana Maharshi   
   
> Once you have passed through trial by fire, and you are thoroughly convinced that you will let go no matter what, then the veils of the human mind and heart will fall away. You will stand face-to-face with what is beyond you because there is no longer a need for you. When you are done playing with the temporal and finite, you will open to the eternal and infinite. Then the word ‘happiness’ can’t describe your state. That’s where words like ecstasy, bliss, liberation, [Nirvana](/not_created.md), and freedom come in. The joy becomes overwhelming, and your cup runneth over. — Michael Singer   
   
> The term peak experiences is a generalization for the best moments of the human being, for the happiest moments of life, for experiences of ecstasy, rapture, bliss, of the greatest joy. I found that such experiences came from profound aesthetic experiences such as creative ecstasies, moments of mature love, perfect sexual experiences, parental love, experiences of natural childbirth, and many others. I use the term—peak experiences—as a kind of generalized and abstract concept because I discovered that all of these ecstatic experiences had some characteristics in common. — Abraham Maslow, The Farther Reaches of Human Nature
