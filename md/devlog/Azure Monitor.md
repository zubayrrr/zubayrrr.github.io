Azure Monitor is a cloud-based monitoring and diagnostics service provided by Microsoft Azure. It helps organizations to monitor and diagnose the performance and availability of their Azure resources, applications, and services, and to identify and respond to issues and problems.   
   
When logs are collected by Azure Monitor, they are typically stored in a storage account in [Azure Storage](../devlog/Azure%20Storage.md). The specific storage account and container used to store logs can be configured in the Azure Monitor settings, and can be different for each log type and each Azure resource.
