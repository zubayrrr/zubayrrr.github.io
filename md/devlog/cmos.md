CMOS is really our configuration of [bios](../devlog/bios.md)/[uefi](../devlog/uefi.md) possible settings.   
   
CMOS is not firmware instruction like BIOS but our configuration of it.   
   
CMOS Battery makes sure our BIOS settings are retained even if our machine is powered off for long periods of time.
