According to [ITIL 4](https://www.atlassian.com/itsm/itil), a configuration management database (CMDB) “is used to store configuration records throughout their lifecycle and...maintain the relationships between [them].”   
   
In other words, your CMDB stores information on the configuration of items within an organization, including hardware, software, systems, facilities, and sometimes personnel. It is the purview of the IT organization to define which items should be tracked and how to do so. This configuration data can include relationships and interdependencies between items, the history of changes to each item, and class and attributes—such as type, owner, and importance—for each item.   
   
Within a CMDB, these tracked items are known as [configuration item](../devlog/Configuration%20Item.md) (CIs). As defined by ITIL 4, CIs are “any component that needs to be managed in order to deliver an IT service.”   
   
By centralizing all configuration information, leaders can better understand critical CIs and their relationships. CMDBs are important in impact analysis, root cause analysis, legal compliance, [incident management](https://www.atlassian.com/itsm/incident-management), and [change management](https://www.atlassian.com/itsm/change-management).
