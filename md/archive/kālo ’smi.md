BG 11.32: The Supreme Lord said: I am mighty Time, the source of destruction that comes forth to annihilate the worlds. Even without your participation, the warriors arrayed in the opposing army shall cease to exist. — via [Chapter 11, Verse 32 – Bhagavad Gita, The Song of God – Swami Mukundananda](https://www.holy-bhagavad-gita.org/chapter/11/verse/32)
