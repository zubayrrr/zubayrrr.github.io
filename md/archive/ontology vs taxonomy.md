According to [Bob Bater](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bobbater/), “an [ontology](../archive/ontology.md) identifies and distinguishes concepts and their relationships; it describes content and relationships. A taxonomy formalizes the hierarchical relationships among concepts and specifies the term to be used to refer to each; it prescribes structure and terminology.”
