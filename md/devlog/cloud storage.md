- Storage available over a network (such as through public cloud: AWS, Google Cloud, etc)   
- We're not concerned with disk interfaces, the configuration, syncing, cables, thats the provider's responsibility   
   
### Considerations   
   
   
- Redundant internet connections   
- Automatic synchronization   
- Server-side encryption of data at rest   
- Data sovereignty
