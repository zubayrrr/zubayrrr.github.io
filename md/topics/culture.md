> Perhaps Danish happiness is not really happiness at all, but something much more valuable and durable: contentedness, being satisfied with your lot, low-level needs being met, higher expectations being kept in check.   
   
When you view the Blue Zones holistically, you typically find cultural lifestyle factors including:   
   
   
- Connection: Meaningful relationships (“us” vs. “me”)   
- Modified Mediterranean Diet: Mostly plant-based diets, drink wine and tea   
- with family and friends   
- Clear Purpose: Based on satisfying low-level needs   
- Time Abundance: No care about time or watching the clock   
- Natural Movement: Walkable communities, gardening, enjoy physical work and   
- find joy in everyday chores, enjoy being outside, etc   
- Down Shift: Little to no stress or anxiety (that leads to inflammation which leads   
- to diseases)   
- Spirituality: Practicing any faith can add years to your life   
- Sleep: Wake naturally, naps in the afternoon (nap research backs their   
- benefits)   
- Environment: Live near water or nature
