Do Your Research   
   
Before an interview, spend a few hours researching the company and role.   
   
At a minimum, you should cover:   
   
• Company mission   
   
• Recent company news   
   
• Recent market news   
   
• Backgrounds of leaders   
   
• Backgrounds of interviewers   
   
Google is a powerful asset—use it.

Embrace “I Don’t Know”   
   
You can’t know the answer to every question. And you know what? That’s ok.   
   
Don’t be afraid to say “I don’t know”—but follow it with a plan to acquire that information.   
   
Ex: “I don’t know, but I’ll dig in and follow up via email.”   
   
Then actually follow up!

Leverage Warm Intros   
   
Warm intros are the holy grail of a competitive hiring process.   
   
Scan your networks for any connections to a company—yes, LinkedIn is actually useful for something!   
   
If you find any that are close enough, use them.

> Part 1: Foot in the Door   
   
The hiring process is ultra-competitive.   
   
There always seems to be an overabundance of candidates applying for the same highly sought-after roles.   
   
You can't land the job if they won't even give you a chance.   
   
5 methods to get your foot in the door:

Prepare for “Why Us?”   
   
Interviewers inevitably ask, “Why us?”—make sure you're prepared for it.   
   
Leverage your research. Write down 2-3 unique points about the company that appeal to you.   
   
The more specific, the better.   
   
Generic answers get minus points. Specific answers win.

Pass the Plane Test   
   
There’s a common—and dated!—test in the hiring process:   
   
“Would I want to sit next to this person on a plane for 6 hours?”   
   
This was about being “normal”—but normalcy is overrated.   
   
Be yourself, but be sure to get across that you're kind and genuine.

Cite Real Weaknesses   
   
Getting asked about your weaknesses feels like a trap, so we tend to cite weaknesses that could be viewed as strengths.   
   
“I’m TOO detail oriented."   
   
I once told a finance interviewer I didn’t know accounting—but that I would learn it. That’s a real weakness!

Highlight Learning as a Goal   
   
When asked about your goals, always highlight learning.   
   
Lifelong learners tend to be great employees—they're interested, intellectually curious, and driven to do more than what is asked of them.   
   
Emphasize your focus on lifelong learning.

Ask Unique Questions   
   
Most interviews end with a classic: “Do you have any questions for me?”   
   
This isn’t a throwaway.   
   
It's an opportunity to show off your differentiated initiative.   
   
Ask a unique question grounded in your research on the company.   
   
Leave a great last impression.

Personalized Thank Yous   
   
After an interview, always make it a point to send a thank you note to the interviewer.   
   
It should be concise and direct.   
   
Include a specific, personalized detail from the interview—something you found interesting or a key follow up.   
   
This stands out!

Stop Fearing Rejection   
   
I’m not ashamed to admit that I’ve been rejected for more jobs than I can count.   
   
It happens—you can’t be a fit for everything and everyone.   
   
Stop fearing rejection and put yourself out there.   
   
Remember: You miss 100% of the shots you don’t take.
