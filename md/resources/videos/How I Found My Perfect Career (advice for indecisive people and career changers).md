She talks about how she got herself into something that she soon lost interest in and how she used her [identity capital](../../archive/identity%20capital.md) ; whatever experience she had to find a job/position that she was hardly qualified for(personally, this is circumstantial, i.e she got lucky), she stopped pursuing what she had initially started off because she realised it was [sunk-cost fallacy](../../archive/sunk-cost%20fallacy.md) that kept her going as long as it did.   
   
she took a leap of faith and decided to pursue something in IT full time, because she had a [bias towards action](../../archive/bias%20towards%20action.md)(see also: [action bias](../../archive/action%20bias.md))   
   
she also landed internships, she learned during recruiting/interviewing cycle is that: personality, context and a little bit of **trying** can get you far in life.   
   
She was not qualified for these internships but she had the right **personality**, she stood out by showing her real self.   
   
Shes really good at communication, she emphasised on showing that in her interviews and also that she **cares**: “I don’t think this right now but I’ll make sure I’ll know it when I start my internship”.   
   
   
- Start experimenting early    
- be aware of sunk cost fallacy   
- build identity capital   
   
## My thoughts    
   
Overall pretty generic advice(by which I mean I did not learn anything that I didn’t already know) but I feel like I definitely feel like if I play my cards right I might also end up finding that role that I love just as she loves hers.
