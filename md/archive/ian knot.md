# [Ian's Shoelace Site – Ian Knot (Ian's Fast Shoelace Knot)](https://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/ianknot.htm)   
   
![Ian Knot diagram](https://www.fieggen.com/Ian-Knot-0.gif)   
   
My own *Ian Knot* (yes – I'm [the inventor](https://www.fieggen.com/ianknothistory.htm "Ian's invention of the Ian Knot in 1982")) is the **World's Fastest Shoelace Knot**. Make a loop with both ends and simultaneously pull them through each other to form an almost instant knot.   
   
   
### Quick Preview:   
   
![Ian Knot GIF animation](https://www.fieggen.com/Dont_Link/IanKnot32_160x120.gif "Ian Knot GIF animation")   
   
Before we begin, here's a small GIF animation of my *Ian Knot* to prove that it **really is** the world's fastest.   
   
## Regular Instructions   
   
The following are the **regular** instructions and diagrams for my *Ian Knot*. See also my **detailed** instructions and finger illustrations starting from [Step 8](https://www.fieggen.com/#detailed "Skip to detailed instructions (below)") (below).   
   
### Step 1:   
   
![Begin with regular “Starting Knot”](https://www.fieggen.com/Dont_Link/knots/Starting-Knot-4.png "Begin with regular “Starting Knot”")   
   
Begin with a regular Left-over-Right [Starting Knot](https://www.fieggen.com/startknot.htm "Starting Knot").   
   
*(See also illustration at [Step 8](https://www.fieggen.com/#step8 "Skip to Step 8 (below)"))*   
   
### Step 2:   
   
![Fold both lace ends into “loops”](https://www.fieggen.com/Dont_Link/knots/Ian-Knot-2.png "Fold both lace ends into “loops”")   
   
Make both ends into “loops” by simply doubling them back onto themselves.   
   
*(See also illustration at [Step 9](https://www.fieggen.com/#step9 "Skip to Step 9 (below)"))*   
   
### Step 3:   
   
![Twist both loops anti-clockwise](https://www.fieggen.com/Dont_Link/knots/Ian-Knot-3.png "Twist both loops anti-clockwise")   
   
Twist both loops **anti-clockwise** so that the left (yellow) loose end is at the **front** and the right (blue) loose end is at the **back**.   
   
*(See also illustration at [Step 10](https://www.fieggen.com/#step10 "Skip to Step 10 (below)"))*   
   
### Step 4:   
   
![Cross loops, left (yellow) in front](https://www.fieggen.com/Dont_Link/knots/Ian-Knot-4.png "Cross loops, left (yellow) in front")   
   
Cross the loops with the **left** (yellow) loose end in **front**.   
   
NOTE: The loops are really more “alongside” each other, which is difficult to illustrate.   
   
*(See also illustration at [Step 11](https://www.fieggen.com/#step11 "Skip to Step 11 (below)"))*   
   
### Step 5:   
   
![Feed loops through each other](https://www.fieggen.com/Dont_Link/knots/Ian-Knot-5.png "Feed loops through each other")   
   
Each hand uses the two fingers inside its **own** loop to grab the loose end of the **other** hand's loop.   
   
*(See also illustration at [Step 12](https://www.fieggen.com/#step12 "Skip to Step 12(below)"))*   
   
### Step 6:   
   
![Loops emerge from both sides](https://www.fieggen.com/Dont_Link/knots/Ian-Knot-6.png "Loops emerge from both sides")   
   
Each hand releases its own loop and pulls the loose end of the opposite loop through its own.   
   
*(See also illustration at [Step 13](https://www.fieggen.com/#step13 "Skip to Step 13 (below)"))*   
   
### Step 7:   
   
![Pull tight to complete the knot](https://www.fieggen.com/Dont_Link/knots/Ian-Knot-7.png "Pull tight to complete the knot")   
   
Pull both loops tight to complete the knot.   
   
*(See also illustration at [Step 14](https://www.fieggen.com/#step14 "Skip to Step 14 (below)"))*   
   
## Detailed Instructions   
   
The following are **detailed** instructions and finger illustrations for my *Ian Knot*. See also my **regular** instructions and diagrams starting from [Step 1](https://www.fieggen.com/#knotsteps "Skip to regular instructions (above)") (above).   
   
### Step 8:   
   
![Begin with regular “Starting Knot”](https://www.fieggen.com/Dont_Link/knots/Ian-Knot-8.png "Begin with regular “Starting Knot”")   
   
Begin with a regular Left-over-Right [Starting Knot](https://www.fieggen.com/startknot.htm "Starting Knot").   
   
*(See also diagram at [Step 1](https://www.fieggen.com/#step1 "Skip to Step 1 (above)"))*   
   
### Step 9:   
   
![Fold both lace ends into “loops”](https://www.fieggen.com/Dont_Link/knots/Ian-Knot-9.png "Fold both lace ends into “loops”")   
   
Hold the left (yellow) lace **around** the left thumb and forefinger, using the other fingers of the left hand to hold the lace taut. Hold the right (blue) lace **between** the right thumb and forefinger.   
   
*(See also diagram at [Step 2](https://www.fieggen.com/#step2 "Skip to Step 2 (above)"))*   
   
### Step 10:   
   
![Twist both loops anti-clockwise](https://www.fieggen.com/Dont_Link/knots/Ian-Knot-10.png "Twist both loops anti-clockwise")   
   
The left hand simply rotates forwards so that the left (yellow) loose end is at the **front**. The right middle finger pushes the right (blue) loose end to the **back**.   
   
*(See also diagram at [Step 3](https://www.fieggen.com/#step3 "Skip to Step 3 (above)"))*   
   
### Step 11:   
   
![Cross loops, left (yellow) in front](https://www.fieggen.com/Dont_Link/knots/Ian-Knot-11.png "Cross loops, left (yellow) in front")   
   
The left thumb pushes the left (yellow) loose end over to the **right**, while the right middle finger continues to push the right (blue) loose end all the way between the left thumb and forefinger to end up **inside** the left loop.   
   
*(See also diagram at [Step 4](https://www.fieggen.com/#step4 "Skip to Step 4 (above)"))*   
   
### Step 12:   
   
![Feed loops through each other](https://www.fieggen.com/Dont_Link/knots/Ian-Knot-12.png "Feed loops through each other")   
   
The left thumb and forefinger grab the **right** (blue) loose end, while the right thumb and middle finger grab the **left** (yellow) loose end.   
   
*(See also diagram at [Step 5](https://www.fieggen.com/#step5 "Skip to Step 5 (above)"))*   
   
### Step 13:   
   
![Loops emerge from both sides](https://www.fieggen.com/Dont_Link/knots/Ian-Knot-13.png "Loops emerge from both sides")   
   
Each hand releases its own loop and pulls the loose end of the opposite loop through its own. Take care **not** to pull the ends all the way through, as this will form a “knot” instead of a “bow”. In fact, this is a quick way to tie a *“Starting Knot”* (although the finger movements must be reversed left/right to balance the finished knot).   
   
*(See also diagram at [Step 6](https://www.fieggen.com/#step6 "Skip to Step 6 (above)"))*   
   
### Step 14:   
   
![Pull tight to complete the knot](https://www.fieggen.com/Dont_Link/knots/Ian-Knot-14.png "Pull tight to complete the knot")   
   
Pull both loops tight to complete the knot. With practice, I can now tie my shoelaces in about **one third** of the time of a conventional knot!   
   
*(See also diagram at [Step 7](https://www.fieggen.com/#step7 "Skip to Step 7 (above)"))*   
   
NOTE: You don't have to follow my instructions to the letter. So long as you retain the “core” of the technique, you are welcome to use whatever finger movements are most comfortable for you.   
   
   
NOTE: If your finished knot comes out crooked, it's probably because you tie your [Starting Knot](https://www.fieggen.com/startknot.htm "Starting Knot") the opposite way to mine. This will result in an un-balanced *“Granny Knot”*, which sits crooked and comes undone more easily. See my [Granny Knot](https://www.fieggen.com/grannyknot.htm "Granny Knot") page for more information.
