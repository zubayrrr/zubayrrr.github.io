Infrastructure as code is an IT practice that manages an application's underlying IT infrastructure through programming. This approach to resource allocation allows developers to logically manage, monitor and provision resources -- as opposed to requiring that an operations team manually configure each required resource.   
   
Managing infrastructure (servers, network, etc) through definition files rather than manual configuration. Much like [configuration management](../devlog/configuration%20management.md), this enables automation, consistency, and is self-documenting.
