State machine is a collection of states, each state will take input from the previous state and that state will send itâ€™s output to the next state.   
   
AWS Step Functions lets us coordinate multiple AWS Services into [serverless](../devlog/serverless.md) **workflows**. We can design and run workflows that stitch together services like [AWS Lambda](../devlog/AWS%20Lambda.md), [AWS Fargate](../devlog/AWS%20Fargate.md), [AWS Sagemaker](../devlog/AWS%20Sagemaker.md) into feature rich applications.   
   
   
- Configure: Define your workflow as a series of steps such as tasks, choices, parallel execution and timeouts.   
- Populate: Connect tasks to code hosted in functions, instances and on-prem servers.   
- Run: We provide any needed input and run your workflow as many times as needed for up to 1 year.   
- Evolve: We can swap out tasks, change the order of steps or add new steps without changing code.   
   
## Use cases   
   
   
- Processes that extend beyond 15 minutes life of a [AWS Lambda](../devlog/AWS%20Lambda.md) function.   
- One function for one task.   
- Business processes(user intervention).   
- Parallel execution of Lambda functions.
