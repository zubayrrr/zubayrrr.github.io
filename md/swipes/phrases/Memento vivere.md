Memento vivere. Remember that you must LIVE.   
   
This Latin phrase the opposite imperative of the more commonly known [memento mori](../../archive/memento%20mori.md) meaning “remember that you must die” which is the medieval Latin Christian theory and practice of reflection on mortality - particularly as a means of considering the vanity of earthly life, and the transient nature of all earthly goods and pursuits. Memento mori as objects or in images were intended to simultaneously serve as memento vivere — reminders to live, and to live as well as you can.   
   
Beauty, vigor and physical strength will all fade. Your wealth will pass to another. The key to living well, is not to live for these transient things. There is an omniscient balance between accepting mortality and embracing life.
