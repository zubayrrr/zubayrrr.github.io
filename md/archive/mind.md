Most scientists today hold the position that the mind and the brain are one and the same. Scientists taking this position, known as [monism](/not_created.md), believe that in order to achieve the most full understanding of mental processes and behavior, we have to include the brain and the body in that formulation, acknowledging the very reality that we have brains and bodies in which mental processes and behavior “live.”   
   
Psychologist Neil Carlson states, “What we call the ‘mind’ is a consequence of the functioning of the human body and its interactions with the environment.” This is a powerful idea — the key to unlocking the mysteries of such psychological concepts as thinking and feeling lies in a thorough understanding of human biology.
