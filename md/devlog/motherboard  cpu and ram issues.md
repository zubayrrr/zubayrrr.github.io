- Also look for distended capacitor in case of motherboard failure, if you see bloated capacitors, motherboard will have to be replaced.   
- Disable CPU overclocking if its overheating (you can disable it using jumper cables or from BIOS/UEFI).   
- Do a RAM test if there's a problem with RAM.   
- If you're not grounded properly there's a chance of frying the RAM - or any circuits really because of electronic static discharge.   
- If BIOS keeps resetting, consider replacing CMOS battery   
- Refer to log entries related to hardware failure. (Windows Kernel event ID 41).
