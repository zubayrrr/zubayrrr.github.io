Container Orchestration tools exist to make your life easier by giving you a way for managing, scaling and deploying containers.   
   
Suppose you've a bunch of containers deployed on [aws.EC2](../devlog/aws.EC2.md) instances, can you answer how are you going to accomplish the following this?:   
   
   
- How do you know how much resource is still available?   
- Where to schedule next container?   
- Have any containers crashed?   
- Setting up load balancing   
- How to compare actual and desired state?   
   
Following are some of the Container Orchestration tools that you can use:   
   
   
- [Kubernetes](../devlog/kubernetes.md)   
- [Mesos](../devlog/mesos.md)   
- [docker swarm](../devlog/docker%20swarm.md)
