Metta is a form of loving-kindness meditation that involves focusing on feelings of kindness, compassion, and goodwill towards oneself and others. It is a practice that originates in the Buddhist tradition and is often taught as a way to cultivate positive emotions and cultivate a sense of connection with others.   
   
In metta meditation, practitioners may repeat phrases such as "may all beings be happy," "may all beings be safe," "may all beings be healthy," and "may all beings live with ease." These phrases are meant to be repeated in the mind or spoken aloud, and can be directed towards oneself, a loved one, a neutral person, a difficult person, and all beings. The idea is to cultivate feelings of compassion and loving-kindness towards oneself and others, and to let go of judgment and negativity.   
   
Metta meditation is often considered a form of compassion meditation, and is believed to have numerous benefits, including reducing stress and promoting feelings of well-being. It is often taught in conjunction with other mindfulness practices and can be a powerful tool for cultivating a sense of inner peace and connection with others.
