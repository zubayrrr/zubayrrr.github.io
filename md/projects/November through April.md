The workout plan/routine/split for the next 6 months(i.e, November through April).   
   
## Goals   
   
### Fat loss/Cutting/Getting Ripped   
   
Some say I am fat, I say its time I stopped bulking( \*winky face emoji\*)   
   
   
- Lose 10 kgs of fat   
- Currently, I am at 87 kg   
- The logistics of losing 10 kgs of fat in 6 months would involve me doing a lot of cardio(I am aware one can lose fat without working out but I’d rather not starve myself)   
- [ ] Calculate current daily calorie intake   
- [ ] Calculate ideal calorie intake (taking in account the deficit)   
   
   
### Hypertrophy/Lean Muscle Gain   
   
   
- I would like to gain muscle, especially on arms and abdominal.   
- [ ] Are deadlifts enough to make abdominal muslces?   
- [ ] Learn more about your affliction (muscle spasms after working abs)   
- I’d like to add significant amount of muscle to my deltoid.   
	- Learn more about the best way to grow shoulders (rear and lateral)   
   
### Strength   
   
I don’t want this “transformation” of mine to affect my original goal when I started taking lifting seriously. That was:

Well along with the above image my original goal was to deadlift 200+ kg, bench press 150 kg, squat 200 kg.   
   
I’d still like to pursue these after my hiatus of 7 months that ended in Oct 2022.   
   
Anyway, given all these requirements I need to make a nice workout plan. Granted I’ll have to make some sacrifices as I will not be able to do this thing “full-time” with my job and everything in my way.

##  Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE)   
   
Your Current Weight : **87 Kg**   
   
Your Target Weight : **75 Kg**   
   
Duration : **13 weeks**   
   
   
- Calories required to maintain your current weight : **3035** calories/day.   
- Calories needed to achieve your target weight : **2019** calories/day.   
- This means you either need to exercise in order to burn the extra **1016** calories or you should reduce your daily calorie intake by **1016** calories.   
   
## Burning 1,000 Calories/Day   
   
### HIIT cycling   
   
A HIIT cycling session for 30 minutes can burn anywhere from 390-690 calories. But you have to be a heavier person and pedal at close to a 32 kmph pace to get to the higher end of that range. If you’re a smaller individual or don’t pedal that fast, it can take at least 90 minutes to burn 1,000 calories.   
   
The one drawback of HIIT workouts is that you can’t sustain a high-intensity pace for very long because they require you to move at an intensity that you can only maintain for a few seconds. It’s not recommended to do HIIT workouts more than two to three days per week because of how taxing they are on the body.   
   
### Cycling   
   
**If you’re cycling at a rate of 10-12mph, you can burn roughly 7 calories per minute depending on how much you weigh. If you bump up the intensity to 14-16mph, you can burn up 15 calories per minute.**   
   
Based on these numbers, you’d have to maintain a pace of 14 mph for about 65-70 minutes to burn 1,000 calories.   
   
### Elliptical Machine   
   
Like most cardio activities, how many calories you burn on the elliptical depends on the level of effort you put into it.    
   
**An average person can burn anywhere from 350-450 calories per hour moving at a moderate pace. You’d have to spend more than two hours on it to burn 1,000 calories.**   
   
## NEAT   
   
NEAT stands for non-exercise activity thermogenesis, which encompasses the daily activities you do outside of exercising. Increasing your NEAT is an excellent way to boost your total daily calorie output.   
   
   
---   
So, I still have to calculate my actual daily calorie intake(using a scale and healthifyme App) but in the mean time, I am gonna layout a rough workout routine.   
   
Eventually, I would like to move on to bodyweight training as I want to focus the rest of my workout journey for longevity, athleticism, agility etc and having a lot of muscle can hinder that(Not in all cases but in most).   
   
So I want my routine to be a lot more bodyweight training focused and it is through the 6-35 rep range(to failure) I am gonna stimulate muscle growth.   
   
Although I am going to continue working on the stronglifts such as Deadlift, bench and squat.   
   
I will do sets of 5 for 5 rep and 1 rep max(to failure) but I will decrease the amount of volume. I want to take my sweet to time to reach my PR goal with these exercises. But only 1 strong lift a day for now.   
   
Having that in mind, here’s my plan that I crafted with whatever knowledge I have with workout plan programming.   
   
| Day    | Exercises  | Notes |   
|:------ |:---------- |:----- |   
| Monday | <ul><li>Back Hyperextension(3 x 8 – 12)</li><li>Pull ups(3 sets to failure)</li><li>Deadlifts(5 x 5)</li><li>Rows(any kind, variety 3 x 8 – 12)</li><li>Chest supported dumbbell lateral raises(3 x 12 – 15)</li><li>45 mins on elliptical</li></ul>|   deadlift and back focused, since sets are less try to do every rep with perfect form and build mind to muscle connection   |

Okay, I just came back from a workout and I have had a change of plans.   
   
To put it simply, in the next 6 months, I want to lose 12 kgs of fat. Why take so much time? Realistic goals. I want to give myself enough time to achieve my goal instead of burning myself out.    
   
My goal is to build strength(enough to hit my PR goals) and lose fat and have fun and be able to work without breaking down because of CNS fatigue.   
   
So, here’s how I want to do it:   
   
   
- Do only the exercises that will help me IMPROVE my strong lifts.   
- Do cardio 5 days a week and burn 600-700 calories.   
- Track my calorie intake and and reduce it by 500.   
- Learn about fat loss, hypertrophy and combat sports.   
- When I am done losing weight and reaching my PR goals for strong lifts I wanna dive into bodyweight training for longevity, agility, metabolism, athleticism and for combat sports.   
   
For this, I will research into each of the lifts, how to improve them using support exercises and also look into losing fat the scientific way.   
   
This project is not only for me to reach my goals with my body but also to learn everything there is (maybe not everything but just enough to call myself an intermediate “knower” of this field).

Its [2022-19-12](/not_created.md) and I am changing things.   
   
So I failed miserably.   
   
I was not able to hit the gym regularly because of my hectic work-life and maybe other reasons.   
   
My workouts were okay, I felt content with what I was doing but I was only going to the gym twice or thrice a week.   
   
My diet is also really weird, I don’t eat food at the same time everyday making it very hard for my body to manage my energy levels.   
   
Sometimes I need more time to recoup my mental energy sometimes I am just low on physical energy.   
   
IN ANY CASE, I am changing things. Soon, I’ll be moving to a new place, where I have ample space to keep my gym equipment(when I can afford it) but I’ve decided to start working out at home.   
   
I was gonna start doing body weight training eventually but I wanna do it sooner rather than later.   
   
This way, I won’t have to worry about dragging myself to the gym or about wasting time.   
   
About losing weight…   
   
I am gonna start running. I have a ground near my house where I can run everyday for 30 minutes. I am terrible at running but its the best way.   
   
I am also going to look into other ways of losing weight..consuming less calories BUT I JUST DON’T WANT TO FEEL LOW AT WORK!!!   
   
for now, its calisthenics babbyyyy.   
   
   
---   
   
## Chest   
   
The first progression level is the standard push-up, but going all the way down to the floor and all the way up for full muscle activation is recommended. The next progression is adding weight to the back using a backpack with bottles, followed by adding a stretch component by placing the hands on an elevated surface such as books. Using a weighted vest, single arm push-ups, decline push-ups with elevated feet, and reverse grip push-ups with palms facing forward is also recommended. Keep the  rep range between  5-15.    
   
**The importance of training to absolute muscular failure, defined as the point where the last rep is significantly more difficult and slower than the first rep and the person could not perform another rep even if threatened with a gun.**     
   
## Back   
   
Alternate between pull up and chin ups everyday. Try different variations including negatives during your push ups.   
   
## Shoulders   
   
   
- Hand stand push ups   
- Pike push ups   
	- Flare out your elbows

	- Experiment with different grips   
- Ring exercises   
- Rowing with bands   
- Bent over dumbell rows   
- Lateral raises   
	- Use bands

## Formula to determine your bench press 1 RPM using push ups   
   
`bodyweight kg * 0.6 * (1 + (3 * push ups/100))`   
   
push ups = max push ups in one set

Note: those are the number of sets you need PER WEEK   
   
## Factors to multiply by for finding out how many sets you require per week

and for example if you get **15** as the answer

with this setup, if you are going to do workout 3x/week this is how your workout routine would look like:
