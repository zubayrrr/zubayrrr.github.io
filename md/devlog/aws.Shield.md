AWS Shield is a managed AWS Cloud service for DDoS protection against all known infrastructure (layer 3 and 4) attacks.   
   
AWS Shield is available at two different tiers, AWS Shield Standard and AWS Shield Advanced, and AWS Shield Advanced has a lot more power and protection on offer than the Standard version.   
   
## AWS Shield Standard   
   
AWS Shield Standard is free, and it offers DDoS protection against some of the more common layer 3, the network layer, and layer 4, the transport layer, DDoS attacks. This protection is **applied automatically** and transparently to your **Elastic Load Balancers, Amazon CloudFront distributions, and Amazon Route 53.**   
   
## AWS Shield Advanced   
   
This paid service provides additional DDoS mitigation capability, intelligent attack detection, and mitigation against attacks at the application (AWS WAF included) and network layers.   
   
Shield Advanced also provides additional detection and mitigation against large and sophisticated DDoS attacks and near real-time visibility into attacks.
