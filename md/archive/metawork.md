Metawork is work directed towards the systems and tools we use to accomplish our goals.   
   
Metawork can be helpful. It improves our systems and tools, enabling us to execute our goals more quickly.   
   
Metawork becomes a problem when we mistake it for actual work. It can become a form of procrastination. It can allow us to feel productive when we're not progressing towards our goals. â€” via [The allure of metawork (and changes to my reading process)](https://newsletter.tylersuzukinelson.com/posts/the-allure-of-metawork-and-changes-to-my-reading-process)
