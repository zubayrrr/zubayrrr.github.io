Machines sharing resources directly among themselves.   
   
Administration and backup is difficult as all the files and resources are located in different locations/machines.   
   
   
- Pros:   
  - Peer-to-Peer file sharing such as Napster   
  - Lower cost   
  - No dedicated resources   
  - No specialized OS   
- Cons:   
  - Decentralized management   
  - Inefficient for large networks   
  - Poor scalability
