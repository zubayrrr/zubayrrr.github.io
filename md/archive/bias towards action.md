The tendency to take action to move towards a goal, even if you don’t know what the outcome is going to be and not getting stuck in “analysis paralysis”   
   
> Having a bias for action means you’re not afraid to make decisions and take action, even when (especially when) you face uncertainty. Maybe you’ve worked with someone or a team who didn’t have a bias for action. In the face of uncertainty, these individuals freeze and can’t make a decision. They’re afraid of getting it wrong and being held accountable for making a poor decision.
