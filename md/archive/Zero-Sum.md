What does 'Zero-Sum' mean? Zero-sum refers toÂ **a situation where one party's gain equals the loss of the other party**. If you were to add up both parties gains and deduct their losses, you would be left with nothing, zero! Hence the term 'Zero-Sum game'. This is also referred to as "Win/ Lose" or "Fixed Pie" [negotiation](../topics/negotiation.md).
