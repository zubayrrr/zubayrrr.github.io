> Let there be spaces in your togetherness,   
> And let the winds of the heavens dance between you.   
> Love one another but make not a bond of love:   
> Let it rather be a moving sea between the shores of your souls.   
> Fill each other's cup but drink not from one cup.   
> Give one another of your bread but eat not from the same loaf.   
> Sing and dance together and be joyous, but let each one of you be alone, Even as the strings of a lute are alone though they quiver with the same music. Give your hearts, but not into each other's keeping.   
> For only the hand of Life can contain your hearts.   
> And stand together, yet not too near together:   
> For the pillars of the temple stand apart, And the oak tree and the cypress grow not in each other's shadow.   
> â€“ Khalil Gibran, The Prophet
