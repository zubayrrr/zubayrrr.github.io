- [Modem](../devlog/Modem.md) is short for modulator/demodulator.   
- There are two kinds of signals:   
  - A computer **only** reads Digital Signal.   
  - Analog Signal that is used on the internet.   
- To deal with this a modem is introduced - whose responsibility is a to convert the signals from Digital to Analog and vice versa.
