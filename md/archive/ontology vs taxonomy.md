According to [Bob Bater](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bobbater/), “an [ontology](../archive/ontology.md) identifies and distinguishes concepts and their relationships; it describes content and relationships. A taxonomy formalizes the hierarchical relationships among concepts and specifies the term to be used to refer to each; it prescribes structure and terminology.”   
   
The main difference between ontology and taxonomy in the context of [digital garden](../archive/Digital%20Garden.md)ing in Obsidian is that ontology is concerned with the nature of existence and the relationships between different concepts and ideas, while taxonomy is focused on organizing and categorizing information into hierarchical structures.
