In law and government, **De jure** ( day JOOR-ee, dee -⁠, YOOR-ee; Latin: dē iūre pronounced [deː ˈjuːrɛ], "by law") describes practices that are legally recognized, regardless of whether the practice exists in reality. In contrast, de facto ("in fact") describes situations that exist in reality, even if not legally recognized.
