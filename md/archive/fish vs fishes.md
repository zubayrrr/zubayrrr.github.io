                      The most common plural form of <em>fish</em> is indeed <em>fish</em>. However, under certain circumstances, you can use <em>fishes</em> as the plural form of <em>fish</em>. If you, for example, see two trout swimming together, you could say that youâ€™re looking at fish. However, if the two trout were joined by a salmon, you could describe them as <em>fish</em> <b>or</b> <em>fishes</em>. <em>Fish</em> can refer to multiple fish, especially when they are all the same species of fish. <em>Fishes</em>, however, usually refers to multiple species of fish, especially in scientific contexts.
