Multidimensional Database = Cubes   
   
   
- It is not a relational database   
- Specialized "dimensionally-aware" database   
- Leading alternative for 1st Generation DWs   
- For smaller-scale [data warehouse](../devlog/data%20warehouse.md)s and [DM]([data mart](../devlog/data%20mart.md))s   
- Advantages   
  - Fast query response time   
  - "Modest" data volumes   
  - Less flexible data structures then [RDBMS](/not_created.md)   
  - More vendor variations than you'd have with RDBMSs
