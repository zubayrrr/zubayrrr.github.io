title: The human phenomenon is but the sum
updated: 1661082810292

“The human phenomenon is but the sum   
Of densely coiled layers of illusion   
Each of which winds itself on the supreme insanity   
That there are persons of any kind   
When all there can be is mindless mirrors   
Laughing and screaming as they parade about   
in an endless dream   
”   
― Thomas Ligotti
