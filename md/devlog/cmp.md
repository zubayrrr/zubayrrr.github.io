`cmp` command in Linux/UNIX is used to compare the two files byte by byte and helps you to find out whether the two files are identical or not.   
   
   
- When `cmp` is used for comparison between two files, it reports the location of the first mismatch to the screen if difference is found and if no difference is found i.e the files compared are identical.   
- `cmp` displays no message and simply returns the prompt if the the files compared are identical.
