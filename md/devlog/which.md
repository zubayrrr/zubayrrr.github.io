The `which` command can be used to find where a program is located in your Linux file system.   
   
   
- By default it only display's the first match, use `-a` option to make it display all the matches.   
- Examples:   
  - `which echo`   
  - `which -a find`   
  - `which grep pwd ifconfig firefox`
