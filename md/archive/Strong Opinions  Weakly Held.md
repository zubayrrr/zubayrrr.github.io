> “Allow your intuition to guide you to a conclusion, no matter how imperfect — this is the ‘strong opinion’ part. Then –and this is the ‘weakly held’ part– prove yourself wrong. Engage in creative doubt. Look for information that doesn’t fit, or indicators that pointing in an entirely different direction. Eventually your intuition will kick in and a new hypothesis will emerge out of the rubble, ready to be ruthlessly torn apart once again. You will be surprised by how quickly the sequence of faulty forecasts will deliver you to a useful result.” — via [Strong Opinions, Weakly Held — a framework for thinking | by Ameet Ranadive | Medium](https://medium.com/@ameet/strong-opinions-weakly-held-a-framework-for-thinking-6530d417e364)
