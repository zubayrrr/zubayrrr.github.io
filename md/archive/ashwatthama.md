In the Hindu epic the Mahabharata, Ashwathama (Sanskrit: अश्वत्थामा, romanized: Aśvatthāmā) or Drauni is the son of guru Drona and the grandson of the sage Bharadwaja. Ashvatthama is a Maharathi who fought on the Kaurava side against the Pandavas in the Kurukshetra War. He became a Chiranjivi (immortal) due to a curse given to him by Krishna.The deceptive plot of his rumoured death led to the beheading of his grieving father Drona, who was decapitated while meditating for his son's soul. **Ashwatthama** was appointed as the final commander-in-chief of the Kauravas in the Kurukshetra War. Overcome with grief and rage, he slaughters most of the Pandava camp in a single night offensive. Ashwatthama ruled the Northern Panchala being subordinate to the rulers of Hastinapura. He was one of the warriors of the Mahabharat war who crossed all limits of conduct and even misused divine Astras.   
   
According to _The Mahabharata_, Ashwatthama means "the sacred voice which relates to that of a horse".It is so-called because when he was born he cried like a horse.
