- Power related issues can come up with any type of device.   
- The issue can be with power supplies/batteries or uninterruptible power supplies.   
- Insufficient wattage:   
  - Consider total PSU wattage   
  - Consider power draw for all components   
    - Especially high-end video cards   
- Uninterruptible Power Supply   
  - UPS   
  - Battery backup power   
  - Allows graceful shutdown   
   
### Common Power-related Symptoms   
   
   
- No power on startup   
- Consider what has changed?   
- Intermittent power - machine will power up but will randomly shutdown(maybe when the user is performing specific tasks on the machine that is drawing a lot more power)   
- Random card/device failure   
- Power for fans but not for other cards/devices   
- Fan failure - overheating   
- Tripping circuit breakers upon PC power-on   
   
### Solving Power-related Issues   
   
   
- Test PSU with a multimeter   
- If there is a burning smell coming from the PSU - replace it   
- Ensure sufficient wattage   
- Try a different electrical plug   
- Try PSU in a different unit
