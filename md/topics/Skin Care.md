You only need a few products such as:   
   
   
- Moisturiser    
- Sunscreen   
- Retinoid    
- Cleanser    
   
   
## 1. Moisturise twice a day    
   
Rehydrates our skin, replaces lost natural fats and proteins to prevent from a dry skin(which causes inflammation) — to ultimately keep the skin barrier intact.   
   
Recommendations:   
   
   
- Eucerin   
- CeraVe   
- La Roche-Posay   
   
You may also look into a sunscreen + moisturiser combo.   
   
## 2. Use  sunscreen every single day   
   
Regular exposure to sun without any protection will lead to weary and wrinkley skin as you get older.   
   
Technically it is called Photoaging or Dermatoheliosis.   
   
The UV rays from sun causes the DNA on our skin cells to mutate, resulting in dark spots and wrinkles. This DNA mutation can also lead to cancer.   
   
Recommendations:   
   
   
- The sunscreen should have broad spectrum(both UV-A and UV-B rays)   
- SPF should be more than 30 or 50.   
- Feels comfortable to wear.   
   
## 3. Use a Retinoid    
   
Vitamin A   
   
Retinol has bunch of anti-aging effects, it does take a long time to see the results.    
   
They help reduce:   
   
   
- Pigment unevenness   
- Minimize wrinkles  — promotes growth of collagen and elastic fibres in Dermis.    
- Minimize acne breakouts   
- Makes skin regenerate faster   
   
Side effects:   
   
   
- Peeling of the skin   
- Increased sensitivity   
- Might make your feel skin drier(at least in the beginning)   
   
Recommendations:   
   
   
- Retinols are part of Retinoids family but weaker.    
- Retionids are generally prescribed by a doctor and are stronger. (Tretinoin, Adapalene)   
   
## 4. Use a cleanser (optional)   
   
For cleaning your face water is good enough for most people. But you may go for a cleanser if you sweat a lot and you feel dirt on your face.   
   
Ideally, your cleanser should clean your skin(remove oily stuff) without also removing the natural oils of your skin.   
   
Use cleansers with Hyaluronic Acid(moisturiser), Ceramides(fats).   
   
## Look into
