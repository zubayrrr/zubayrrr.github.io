## Notes:   
   
   
- School and education are two different things, you have to educate yourself whether or not you go to a school.   
- Always be curious about he world you're living in, chase down every reference you come across.   
- You found an interesting comment on a random YouTube video? Go down the rabbit hole and dig further   
- Google everything and anything you can.   
- Learn how to effectively search Google.   
- Don't ask a question before you Google it, you'll either find the answer or you'll come up with a better question.   
- Learn to be self reliant.   
- Read.   
- Go to a library if you can or download eBooks, try building reading habit, surround yourself with books, the more the merrier.   
- "it's not the book you start with, it's the book that book leads you to."   
- Collect books even if you don't plan on reading them anytime soon.   
- Be hungry to explore the unknown (what you don't know or have had no awareness about).   
- Don't worry about researching, just starting 'searching' you'll get there eventually.
