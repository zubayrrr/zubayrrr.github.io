The cubensis Mexican Dutch King originates in Mexico but highly cultivated in the Netherlands, the Mexican Dutch King strain is very rhyzomorphic. The mycelium from the Mexican mushroom spores can produce massive yields under a wide variety of conditions.   
   
Thought to be derived from a Psilocybe cubensis (or perhaps Psilocybe mexicana) found in Central America, this cubensis strain was developed by mycologists in Amsterdam. Mature specimens were even sold in cafes there before the laws changed in the Netherlands.   
   
Mexican Dutch King mushroom stems are slim and grow to between 50mm to 120mm in length, are white with slight shades of yellow, and exhibit blue coloration when touched or damaged. This coloration is different from the blueish green colors of other varieties.   
   
Unlike most other varieties, the spores of the Mexican Dutch King mushroom are an almost black dark brown color when viewed under the microscope. They do however have the regular 11.5-17Âµm spore diameter and ellipsoid shape common in other varieties.
