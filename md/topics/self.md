> "Self esteem can fluctuate because sometimes you just don't feel good about yourself and thats fine but self worth should not fluctuate.   
   
Human beings have inherent value just by existing.

## Self Criticism   
   
“The tone of your self-talk is the key, There’s a difference between saying ‘That didn’t work out, I think I might be able to do that better’ versus ‘I can never get this right, I’m such a failure.’ Personal growth is defined as improving through honest reflection, realistic goal setting, and understanding that failure is part of the journey. Self-criticism is the antithesis to growth.” - Amy Cirbus, a New York-based Talkspace therapist.   
   
**Signs You are Being Too Hard On Yourself**   
   
   
- You give up on challenges quickly, fearing you won’t be successful.   
- You ruminate on failures long after they’re over.   
- Your self-talk consists of harsh criticism and generalizations.   
- When situations don’t go as planned, you blame yourself.   
- **You keep commitments to everyone but yourself, believing you’re not as worthy as others.**   
   
**Pay attention to your behavior**   
   
It takes the intentional act of paying close attention to what’s going on inside of ourselves to challenge the negativity. Once we’re paying attention, we can take note of how we speak and treat ourselves in order to create different thought patterns and behaviors. If you’re already telling yourself you won’t succeed, you increase the risk of not succeeding. This can feed into a cycle of proving to yourself that you’re incapable.   
   
**Be positive**   
   
Create a few realistic, positive personal mantras that you can meditate on or even keep close by that can replace negative self-talk. While easier said than done, this is one of the best routes to combat self-criticism. Replace the negative with something better, something positive.   
   
**Be gentle**   
   
Try to instead acknowledge your inner critic and focus on being kind to yourself.   
   
**Understand your actions**   
   
Your behaviors don’t always reflect your character. Practice focusing on finding the difference between the two. You might have failed, but you are not a failure. Mistakes don’t define who you are!   
   
## [Sloww Hierarchy of Happiness](../resources/books/Sloww%20Hierarchy%20of%20Happiness.md)    
   
> We cannot have deep and enduring satisfaction, happiness, or joy unless we have self-respect. There is good reason to believe that self-respect is the basis for all higher morality. We cannot have self-respect unless our lives are an earnest attempt to express the finest and most enduring values which we are able to appreciate. That is to say, unless we come into close and right relationships with our fellow-men, with nature, and with Truth (or God), we cannot achieve full self-respect. — Richard Gregg, The Value of Voluntary Simplicity
