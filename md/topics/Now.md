Now as in this present moment   
   
## Sloww Hierarchy of Happiness – Presence    
   
> Do you want to be happy? Uninterrupted happiness is uncaused. True happiness is uncaused. You cannot make me happy. You are not my happiness. You say to the awakened person, ‘Why are you happy?’ and the awakened person replies, ‘Why not?’ Happiness is our natural state. — Anthony de Mello   
   
> Happiness is a default state. It’s what’s there when you remove the sense that something is missing from your life. — Naval Ravikant   
   
> Wakefulness, happiness—call it what you wish—is the state of nondelusion, where you see things not as you are but as they are, insofar as this is possible for a human being. — Anthony de Mello   
   
> Don’t seek happiness. If you seek it, you won’t find it, because seeking is the antithesis of happiness. Happiness is ever elusive, but freedom from unhappiness is attainable now, by facing what is rather than making up stories about it. Unhappiness covers up your natural state of wellbeing and inner peace, the source of true happiness. — Eckhart Tolle   
   
> You become happy by contact with [reality](../topics/reality.md). That’s what brings happiness, a moment-by-moment contact with reality. That’s where you’ll find God; that’s where you’ll find happiness. — Anthony de Mello   
   
> You are present when what you are doing is not primarily a means to an end (money, prestige, winning) but fulfilling in itself, when there is joy and aliveness in what you do. And, of course, you cannot be present unless you become friendly with the present moment. — Eckhart Tolle   
   
> I don’t live in either my past or my future. I’m interested only in the present. If you can concentrate always on the present, you’ll be a happy man ... Life will be a party for you, a grand festival, because life is the moment we’re living right now. — Paulo Coelho   
   
> Peace is happiness at rest, and happiness is peace in motion. You can convert peace to happiness any time you want, but peace is want you want most of the time ... If you’re a peaceful person, anything you do will be a happy activity. — Naval Ravikant
