GraphX is Spark's own Graph Computation Engine and data store   
   
Where data has some kind of networked connections, X connected to Y, Y connected to Z, Z connected to a and so on; making a relationship.   
   
Where X Y Z are called Vertices, connections between vertices is called edges.   
   
It could be used for networked devices, social media, cloud platform, different devices connected to each other.   
   
   
- Provides a uniform tool for ETL
