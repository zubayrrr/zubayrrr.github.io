The N-tier architecture is a software design pattern that organizes a software application into multiple tiers. The most common form of N-tier architecture is the three-tier architecture, which typically consists of a presentation tier, a business logic tier, and a data storage tier. In this type of architecture, the presentation tier is responsible for displaying information to the user, the business logic tier is responsible for handling the application's business logic and rules, and the data storage tier is responsible for storing and managing the application's data.
