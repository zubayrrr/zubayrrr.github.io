The happiest people are not the ones who achieve the most. They are the ones   
who spend more time than others in a state of flow. — Héctor García and   
Francesc Miralles, Ikigai: The Japanese Secret to a Long and Healthy Life   
Artists, for example, who carry the torch of their ikigai instead of retiring, have this   
power. Art, in all its forms, is an ikigai that can bring happiness and   
purpose to our days. Enjoying or creating beauty is free, and something all   
human beings have access to. — Héctor García and Francesc Miralles
