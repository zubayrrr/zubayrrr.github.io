Do Nothing Tendency   
   
We are more bothered by harm that comes from action than harm that comes from inaction, so we default to no action.   
   
"Most of us have two lives: the life we live, and the unlived life within us"— [@SPressfield](https://twitter.com/SPressfield)   
   
Don't resort to no action as a means of comfort.

[@SPressfield](https://twitter.com/SPressfield) Extremeness Aversion   
   
When making decisions, we seek to avoid the outermost edge of a situation.   
   
We prefer a compromise or middle position.   
   
The middle option allows us to ‘sit on the fence.’   
   
Remember: The edge is where the magic and learning happen.

[@SPressfield](https://twitter.com/SPressfield) Fundamental Attribution Error   
   
We underemphasize situational factors and over-emphasize character traits in assessing others.   
   
You haven't slept well so you know why you're slow, they haven't slept well so you assume they're a slow person.   
   
View other's situations with charity.

[@SPressfield](https://twitter.com/SPressfield) Not Invented Here Bias   
   
We get drunk on our own ideas—whether individual or in a business setting.   
   
Sober up, take a step back.   
   
Examine the quality of your ideas in hindsight.   
   
Which of your ideas from the past 5 years were truly outstanding? My guess is a small few.

[@SPressfield](https://twitter.com/SPressfield) First-Conclusion Bias   
   
We settle on the first information or conclusion for a given problem.   
   
This makes us resistant to asking further questions and searching for further alternatives.   
   
Counter this urge by using decision checklists and objective reasoning—remove your emotions.
