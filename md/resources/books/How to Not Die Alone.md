- While love may be a natural instinct, dating isn’t. We’re not born knowing how to choose the right partner.   
- Intentional Love asks you to view your love life as a series of choices rather than accidents.   
- Great relationships are built, not discovered. A lasting relationship doesn’t just happen. It is the culmination of a series of decisions, including when to get out there, whom to date, how to end it with the wrong person, when to settle down with the right one, and everything in between. Make good decisions, and you propel yourself toward a great love story. Make bad ones, and you veer off course, doomed to repeat the same harmful patterns over and over.   
- But awareness on its own doesn’t lead to action. (Knowing you shouldn’t date “bad boys” or “manic pixie dream girls” doesn’t make them any less appealing.) You have to actually do something about it.   
- There’s no certainty in relationships, but you can approach your decision-making in a more strategic way, pulling from research that understands the strengths and weaknesses of our brains (and our hearts). Intentional Love is informed by both relationship science (what works for long-term relationships) and behavioral science (how to get us to follow through on our intentions).   
   
## How to Understand the Challenges of Modern Dating   
   
**WE SHAPE OUR OWN IDENTITIES**   
   
   
- Religion, community, and social class dictated the lives of our ancestors. Expectations were clear, and personal decisions were few. Based on where and into what kind of family you were born. When it came to finding a partner, the answer often came down to the dowry—who could offer the best acres of land or the largest caravan of camels.   
- Today all these decisions are up to us. Modern life is a path that we must chart on our own. Whereas our predecessors didn’t have to weigh where to live or what to do for a living, we make those choices now. That gives us incredible freedom to shape our identities — but that freedom comes at the cost of certainty. Late at night, our faces lit by the blue glow of our smartphones, we wonder, Who am I? and What am I doing with my life? The dark side of all this freedom and endless choice is the crippling fear that we’ll screw up our lifelong pursuit of happiness. If we’re in charge, then we have only ourselves to blame. We could fail, and then it would be our fault.   
   
**WE HAVE TOO MANY OPTIONS**   
   
   
- Dating itself only began in the 1890s. Online dating started in 1994 with Kiss.com, followed shortly by Match.com a year later. And we’ve been swiping for love for less than a decade. If it feels like we’re in the middle of a gigantic cultural experiment, it’s because we are.   
- While people crave choice, too many options can make us feel less happy and more doubtful of our decisions. They call this the [paradox of choice](../../archive/paradox%20of%20choice.md). we’re crippled by analysis paralysis. And this is especially true when it comes to choosing a life partner.   
   
**WE YEARN FOR CERTAINTY**   
   
   
- We live in an information-rich society that offers the false comfort of research. It can feel like the perfect decision is only a few more Google searches away. It feels like if we can research all our choices, then we can select the right one.   
- We’ve gotten hooked on this feeling of certainty, and we crave it in our romantic lives. But when it comes to relationships, that kind of assurance doesn’t exist. There is no “right answer” to questions like Who should I be with? and How much should I compromise? and Will they ever change?   
- Great relationships are built, not discovered. But our minds are often stuck in a trap, thinking that by combing through hundreds of options, we’ll be closer to knowing whether the one in front of us is “right.”   
   
**SOCIAL MEDIA LEADS US TO COMPARE AND DESPAIR**   
   
   
- Years ago, people lived in communal villages. They witnessed other couples being affectionate, fighting, and making up. There was no such thing as a private problem. Today our primary view into other people’s relationships is staged, curated, Instagram-filtered social media feeds.   
- This leads us to feel like we’re the only ones experiencing heart-wrenching struggles in our love lives. Feeling like everyone else’s relationship is perfect when yours is floundering (or nonexistent) exacerbates that pain. I find this is especially true for men, who tend to have smaller social networks and fewer people with whom they can share their fears. They’re even less likely to talk to their friends about their problems and learn that everyone, at one time or another, experiences relationship hardships.   
   
**WE LACK RELATIONSHIP ROLE MODELS**   
   
   
- This is a problem. Study after study demonstrates the power of role models. It’s much easier to believe something is possible when you’ve seen someone else do it.   
- Even those of us with the best relationship intentions may struggle because many of us haven’t seen a functional relationship in action.   
   
**THERE ARE FAR MORE WAYS TO BE IN A RELATIONSHIP**   
   
   
- Many of the relationship questions we tackle today such as Are we dating or just hooking up? or Should I break up now or wait until after wedding season is over? We agonize with our close confidants over not knowing whether we’re in love with a new boo or feeling burned out from first dates that go nowhere.   
- Beyond scientific advances, we’re expanding our models for dating and long-term relationships. We’re pondering questions such as Are we monogamous? and How do we define monogamy?   
- In some ways, these questions are exciting. Who doesn’t want to feel free and in control of their destiny? But at a certain point, all these options and opportunities can stop making us feel free and start making us feel overwhelmed.   
   
**WE FEEL PRESSURE TO GET THIS DECISION “RIGHT”**   
   
It can feel like our entire lives hinge on the one major decision of whom to marry. This is especially true for women, who face more time pressure to pick a spouse if they want to have children by a certain age.   
   
## How to Discover Your Dating Blind Spots   
   
_Why has everyone found love except me? I like my job, I like my friends, I like myself. Why hasn’t this one piece of my life fallen into place yet?_   
   
   
- Many people suffer from dating blind spots—patterns of behavior that hold them back from finding love, but which they can’t identify on their own.   
- I’ve categorized the most common blind spots into a framework called **The Three Dating Tendencies**. Each group struggles with unrealistic expectations—of themselves, of partners, and of romantic relationships.   
   
**The Romanticizer**   
   
You want the soul mate, the happily ever after—the whole fairy tale. You love love. You believe you are single because you haven’t met the right person yet. Your motto: It’ll happen when it’s meant to happen.   
   
**The Maximizer**   
   
You love doing research, exploring all of your options, turning over every stone until you’re confident you’ve found the right one. You make decisions carefully. And you want to be 100 percent certain about something before you make your choice. Your motto: Why settle?   
   
**The Hesitater**   
   
You don’t think you’re ready for dating because you’re not the person you want to be yet. You hold yourself to a high standard. You want to feel completely ready before you start a new project; the same goes for dating. Your motto: I’ll wait until I’m a catch.   
   
Although they seem quite different, the Romanticizer, Maximizer, and Hesitater have one major thing in common: unrealistic expectations.   
   
   
- The Romanticizer has unrealistic expectations of relationships.   
- The Maximizer has unrealistic expectations of their partner.   
- The Hesitater has unrealistic expectations of themselves.   
   
## How to Overcome the Romanticizer Tendency   
   
Romanticizers believe that love is something that happens to you, and that the reason they’re single is they just haven’t met the right person yet. Romanticizers might not consciously identify with fairy tales, yet they expect their lives to resemble one. They believe the perfect person will walk into their lives one day. All they have to do is wait for that moment. And once that Prince Charming or Cinderella appears, love will be effortless.
