Peripheral cables provide wired connectivity solution for external devices that add functionality to a PC.   
   
They come in a couple of differnet forms, whether we're talking about Peripheral and Network Cables:   
   
   
- Standard cables contain one or more copper wires to transmit electricity.   
- Fiber optic cables contain glass or plastic fibers to reflect light wavelengths.   
- Cable length determines signal strength and quality, to rectify this, we use a repeater to make the signal strong again.   
   
## Cable Transmission Types   
   
#### Serial Transmission   
   
   
- Transmits one bit at a time down the copper wire   
- More common than parallel (older)   
- Faster transmission rates   
- Universal Serial Bus ([USB](../devlog/usb.md))   
- Serial ATA([SATA](/not_created.md))   
   
#### Parallel Transmission   
   
   
- Transmits multiple bits simultaneously through adjacent copper wires.   
- Older cable type.   
- Electrical signal interference from adjacent wires.   
- Smaller transmission distance than Serial.   
- [PATA](../devlog/pata.md)   
- [SCSI](/not_created.md)

#### Video cables   
   
   
- [VGA](../devlog/vga.md)   
- Digital Video Interface, Video only DVI-D, DVI-A], DVI-I]   
- [DisplayPort](../devlog/displayport.md)   
- [HDMI](../devlog/hdmi.md)   
   
#### Mutlipurpose Cables   
   
   
- [Plenum](../devlog/plenum.md) cabling - used in and near air ventilation systems, if it burns it releases lowest amount of smoke/toxins.   
- [Non-Plenum](../devlog/non-plenum.md) cabling cannot be used in raised floors, ceilings or walls.   
- Thunderbolt - supports both PCI Express + DisplayPort, allows device [Daisy-Chaining](../devlog/daisy-chaining.md) such as monitors and storage drives.   
- Lightning - Allows connectivity between Apple iOS devices and peripherals.
