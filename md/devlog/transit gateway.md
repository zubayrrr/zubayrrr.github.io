A transit gateway is a network gateway that connects different subnets within a virtual private cloud (VPC) or across multiple [VPC](/not_created.md)s. It acts as a central hub that allows you to easily connect your VPCs and on-premises networks to a single gateway. This can help simplify your network architecture and reduce the number of Internet gateways, VPN connections, and peering connections that you need to manage. Transit gateways also support route-based [VPN](/not_created.md)s and direct connect gateways, making it easy to connect your VPCs to your on-premises network or other [AWS](../devlog/aws.md) services.
