## Sloww Hierarchy of Happiness – Purpose   
   
**Happiness is a byproduct of finding meaning and purpose**   
   
> I’ve learned that there is nothing more consistent with unhappiness than spending your time in a way that doesn’t serve who you are ... there is no more profound source of fulfillment and happiness than knowing you are traveling your own path... — Scott Dinsmore   
   
> ‘Years of research on the psychology of well-being have demonstrated that often human beings are happiest when they are engaged in meaningful pursuits and virtuous activities.’ Indeed, when we are deeply engaged in an activity that is in accordance with our best self, we often report the highest levels of life satisfaction. — Scientific American   
   
> Very few follow the path laid out for them—the path to their Personal Legends, and to happiness. — Paulo Coelho   
   
> Happiness cannot be pursued; it must ensue. One must have a reason to ‘be happy.’ Once the reason is found, however, one becomes happy automatically. As we see, a human being is not one in pursuit of happiness but rather in search of a reason to become happy, last but not least, through actualizing the potential meaning inherent and dormant in a given situation.— [Viktor Frankl](/not_created.md), Man’s Search for Meaning   
   
> Pleasure is, and must remain, a side-effect or by-product, and is destroyed and spoiled to the degree to which it is made a goal in itself. — [Viktor Frankl](/not_created.md)   
   
> Once an individual’s search for a meaning is successful, it not only renders him happy but also gives him the capability to cope with suffering. — [Viktor Frankl](/not_created.md)   
   
> The difference between happiness and fulfillment is the difference between liking something and loving something ... Happiness comes from what we do. Fulfillment comes from why we do it. — [Simon Sinek](/not_created.md)   
   
Instead of making happiness the goal, focus on meaning and purpose.   
   
> Many persons have a wrong idea of what constitutes true happiness. It is not attained through self-gratification but through fidelity to a worthy purpose. — Helen Keller   
   
> Our deepest happiness in life stems from fulfilling purpose. Doing the best we can, where we are, with what we’ve been given is the best way to live a life of meaning and significance. — Joshua Becker   
   
Think of it like your system or process or a journey   
   
> When you fall in love with the process rather than the product, you don’t have to wait to give yourself permission to be happy. You can be satisfied anytime your system is running. — James Clear, Atomic Habits   
   
   

   
The happiest people are not the ones who achieve the most. They are the ones   
who spend more time than others in a state of flow. — Héctor García and   
Francesc Miralles, Ikigai: The [Japanese](../topics/Japanese.md) Secret to a Long and Healthy Life   
Artists, for example, who carry the torch of their ikigai instead of retiring, have this   
power. Art, in all its forms, is an ikigai that can bring happiness and   
purpose to our days. Enjoying or creating beauty is free, and something all   
human beings have access to. — Héctor García and Francesc Miralles

Purpose is intertwined with [relationships](../topics/relationships.md)—it goes beyond yourself to serve others and the world:   
   
>  True vocation joins self and service, as Frederick Buechner asserts when he defines vocation as ‘the place where your deep gladness meets the world’s deep need.’ — Parker Palmer, Let Your Life Speak
