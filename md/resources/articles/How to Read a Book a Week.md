1.  **Check out the author’s bio online** to get a sense of the person’s bias and perspective.   
2.  **Read the title, subtitle, front flap, table of contents.** Figure out the big-picture argument of the book, and how that argument is laid out.   
3.  **Read the introduction and conclusion word for word** to figure out where the author starts from and where he eventually gets to.   
4.  **Read/skim each chapter:** Read the title, the first few paragraphs or the first few pages of the chapter to figure out how the author is using the chapter and where it fits into the argument of the whole book. Then skim through headings and subheadings to get an idea of the flow. Read the first sentence and last sentence of each paragraph. Once you get an argument, feel free to move on to the next argument, skipping over the many repeated case studies or examples.   
5.  **End with the table of contents** again, looking through, and summarising each.
