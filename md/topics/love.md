Understanding love not like understanding [relationships](../topics/relationships.md) but like understanding the ethics of **love**.   
   
> 'For many intelligences, the thought of homely intimacies is associated with a spontaneous disgust at too much sweetness–which is why there is neither a philosophy of sweetness nor an elaborated ontology of the intimate.' —Sloterdijk

## [how we think of love is messed up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GU4NWj3sDzk)   
   
   
- [relationships](../topics/relationships.md) are tricky; as portrayed in media and films...or as Kaguya likes to think: Love is war.   
- We go to lengths in the hope of finding that love, from stalking random people on instagram accounts(I don't), swiping people left and right on those countless dating apps.   
- Once you're in a relationship, its a whole different ordeal. Hurt feelings, missed expectations etc etc.   
- Some people just give up when things don't work out like they expected(like myself) and some do mental gymnastics to find a reason to stay.   
   
**[simone de beauvoir](../resources/people/simone%20de%20beauvoir.md) believed love to be an inherent component to the human condition.**   
   
   
- We wish to be with another, to be heard, to be affirmed in who we're. Yet time and again we end up in relationships that leave us hurt and even more confused about who we truly are.   
- For [simone de beauvoir](../resources/people/simone%20de%20beauvoir.md) it only justifies the necessity of the ethics of love.   
- For Beauvoir the very ambiguity of love was a gateway to exploitation.   
	- Apparent in the gendered differences of what it means to love.   
- "Boys, generally speaking were encouraged to have projects for their lives - to see love as part of life, not all of it and to believe that success was possible in more than one part at once."   
- "Girls, by contrast, were encouraged to see love as life itself - and to believe that to succeed at other things might make them less loveable."   
   
   
- Men see freedom as their "calling" - whatever that calling might be.   
- Women are taught that love is their key to freedom.   
   
**This leads to asymmetry in romantic expectations.**   
   
   
- Men have been taught to look at their romantic interests are someone who challenges them and brings out their true potential but nonetheless submit to the man's power.   
- Women in this sense appears to provide almost "mystical" help to this man who has been taught to feel like a protagonist.   
- As pop culture trope the **"Manic Pixie Dream Girl"**, who acts as a quirky, attractive and spontaneous woman who encourages the protagonist through their resistant and yet yielding validation of man's true essence.   
   
Beauvoir poignantly defines this issue early on:   
   
   
- "The average Western male's ideal is a woman who freely submits to his domination, who does not accept his ideas without some discussion, but who yields to his reasoning, who intelligently resists but yields in the end."   
- For both genders Beauvoir discourages us from viewing love as a key to salvation.   
- We should not rely on love to make as feel whole; just like money, goods, social approval (the socially constructed ideas) that promise us freedom and happiness.   
- Treating love as a means to an end will more often than not lead us to unsatisfactory relationships.   
   
   
- In "The Denial of Death", Ernest Becker sees the age of secularism as becoming increasingly reliant on relationships for fulfilling our two ontological motives of "feeling special and unique" and "belonging to something larger".   
- Previously God used to give us this "validation", now we seek them in people.   
- People who have their own issues, existential anxieties and quirks that we need to deal with as they deal with ours.   
- Such relationships often end in boredom, resentment and dissatisfaction.   
- Serving only to distract individuals from facing the fears of meaninglessness and death.   
   
Beauvoir presents two forms of failed love:   
   
   
- Narcissism   
- Devotion   
   
The relationship of Narcissism: "Loving oneself and loving in the other, the love they have for you." Apparent in the Manic Pixie Dream Girl fantasy of the man, who likes the idea of their partner and enjoys the encouragement and validation that comes from being with them. This fulfills the ontological need of feeling "unique" and "special". However their lover is nothing more than a small character in their story. They neglect the "other:" in the relationship with their own potential waiting to be brought out by encouragement and validation. The narcissistic relationship is self serving and dehumanizing. It often leaves the other individual neglected and unwanted.   
   
The relationship of Devotion: If narcissism in a relationship is making your partner feel like a side character, devotion on the other hand is making them(the partner) write the story for you. Apparent in "Love is everything" fantasy socialized among girls. Where the other is to be treated with utmost devotion and total autonomy. The devoted is there to be served entirely and acts as a "gift" to the other. Thus, fulfilling the ontological need of "belonging to something larger". "How special is it that this person as chosen me?" You may even believe that tis "meant to be", slowly forgetting yourself to maintain a relationship that is anything but destined. You make compromises, allowing your "love" to be define who you're. Making is it even more difficult to leave.   
   
Each side is present in any relationship. To like someone a bit too much and also want some space is natural. But when these turn pathological:   
   
Beauvoir thinks. neither is love but reflections of individuals who do not know themselves quite enough. Neither can be acting maliciously but the damage can be done nonetheless.   
   
**Ethical Love** is equilibrium; balance between absolute self interest and absolute selflessness.   
   
Beauvoir notes Ethical Love as to "simply walk side by side, mutually helping each other a little." We give ourselves without losing ourselves. We share each other lives all the while respecting the fact that the good you see in the other cannot be restricted but should be allowed to grow unencumbered by your own idealistic expectations.   
   
You love them for who they're. This can be corrupted if you see the other as either superior or inferior. A healthy relationship is driven by a sense of equality and a shared sense of support.   
   
**This kind of relationship is possible anywhere where a human connection is yearning to flourish.**

> “The moment we choose to love, we begin to move against domination, against oppression. The moment we choose to love we begin to move towards freedom, to act in ways that liberate ourselves and others. That action is the testimony of love as the practice of freedom.” - Hooks

In Christianity, agape from Ancient Greek ἀγάπη (agápē) is "the highest form of love, charity" and "the love of God for man and of man for God". This is in contrast to philia, brotherly love, or philautia, self-love, as it embraces a deep and profound sacrificial love that transcends and persists regardless of circumstance. According to 1 Timothy it comes "out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned". It goes beyond just the emotions to the extent of seeking the best for others. The verb form goes as far back as Homer, translated literally as affection, as in "greet with affection" and "show affection for the dead". Other ancient authors have used forms of the word to denote love of a spouse or family, or affection for a particular activity, in contrast to eros (an affection of a sexual nature).

Eros from Ancient Greek ἔρως (érōs) 'love, desire' is a concept in ancient Greek philosophy referring to sensual or passionate love, from which the term erotic is derived. Eros has also been used in philosophy and psychology in a much wider sense, almost as an equivalent to "life energy". Protestant author C. S. Lewis posits it as one of the four ancient Greek words for love in Christianity, alongside storge, philia, and agape

> “This progressive effacement of human relationships is not without certain problems for the novel. How, in point of fact, would one handle the narration of those unbridled passions, stretching over many years, and at times making their effect felt on several generations? **We’re a long way from Wuthering Heights**, to say the least. The novel form is not conceived for depicting indifference or nothingness; a flatter, more terse, and dreary discourse would need to be invented.” ― Michel Houellebecq, [Whatever](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/56842)
