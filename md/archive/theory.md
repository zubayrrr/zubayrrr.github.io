A theory is a set of related statements about a set of objects or events (the ones being studied) that explains how these objects or events are related. Knowing this is important because a significant amount of psychological knowledge is based on theory. Theories perform two main functions: They combine what is already known into a simpler package of knowledge and they help psychologists plan future investigations: Theories summarize and guide.   
   
Theories and hypotheses are similar but not exactly the same thing. Psychologists test theories by studying their logical implications. Hypotheses are specific predictions based on these implications. You can add new information to theories, and you can use existing theories to generate new ones. Not every theory is a good theory.   
   
In order for a theory to be good, it must meet three criteria:   
   
   
- Parsimony: It must be the simplest explanation possible that still explains the available observation.   
- Precision: It must make precise, not overly large or vague, statements about reality.   
- Testability: It must lend itself to scientific investigation. There must be some way to show that the theory can be wrong. It is easy to collect more information consistent with one’s theory. It is braver to be a scientist: to examine situations that may prove one’s theory wrong.

The Falsification Principle, proposed by Karl Popper, is a way of demarcating science from non-science. It suggests that for a theory to be considered scientific it must be able to be tested and conceivably proven false.   
For example, the hypothesis that "all swans are white," can be falsified by observing a black swan.   
For Popper, science should attempt to disprove a theory, rather than attempt to continually support theoretical hypotheses.   
   
[Karl Popper](/not_created.md) argued that science would best progress using [deductive reasoning](/not_created.md) (as opposed to [inductive reasoning](/not_created.md)) as its primary emphasis, known as critical rationalism.
