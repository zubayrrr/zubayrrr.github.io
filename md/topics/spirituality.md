## Sloww Hierarchy of Happiness – Spirituality    
   
> Happiness cannot be traveled to, owned, earned, worn or consumed. Happiness is the spiritual experience of living every minute with love, grace, and gratitude. — Denis Waitley   
   
> All living beings desire to be happy always, without any misery. In everyone there is observed supreme love for oneself. And happiness alone is the cause of love. In order therefore, to gain that happiness which is one’s nature and which is experienced in the state of deep sleep, where there is no mind, one should know oneself. To achieve this, the Path of Knowledge, the enquiry in the form of ‘Who am I?’, is the principal means. — [Ramana Maharshi](/not_created.md)   
   
> One of the ancient names for God in the yogic tradition is Satchitananda— Eternal, Conscious Bliss. God is ecstasy. God is as high as it gets. If you want to be close to [God](../topics/god.md), learn to be joyful. If you remain spontaneously happy and centered, no matter what happens, you will find God. — Michael Singer   
   
> Many people may doubt that finding God is the purpose of life; but everyone can accept the idea that the purpose of life is to find happiness. I say that God is Happiness. He is Bliss. He is Love. He is Joy that will never go away from your soul. So why shouldn’t you try to acquire that Happiness? No one else can give it to you. You must continuously cultivate it yourself. — Paramahansa Yogananda   
   
> The joy of Being, which is the only true happiness, can not come to you through any form, possession, achievement, person, or event – through anything that happens. That joy cannot come to you – ever. It emanates form the formless dimension within you, from consciousness itself and thus is one with who you are. — Eckhart Tolle
