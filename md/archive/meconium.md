### What Is Meconium?   
   
Meconium is a newborn's first poop. This sticky, thick, dark green poop is made up of cells, protein, fats, and intestinal secretions, like bile. Babies typically pass meconium (mih-KOH-nee-em) in the first few hours and days after birth. But some babies pass meconium while still in the womb during [late pregnancy](https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/pregnancy-calendar-intro.html).   
   
### What Is Meconium Aspiration Syndrome?   
   
Meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS) happens when a [newborn](https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/checkup-hospital.html) has trouble breathing because meconium got into the [lungs](https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/lungs.html).   
   
Meconium can make it harder to breathe because it can:   
   
   
- clog the airways   
- irritate the airways and injure lung tissue   
- block surfactant, a fatty substance that helps open the lungs after birth   
   
### What Causes Meconium Aspiration Syndrome?   
   
Meconium aspiration happens when a baby is stressed and gasps while still in the womb, or soon after delivery when taking those first breaths of air. When gasping, a baby may inhale amniotic fluid and any meconium in it.   
   
Babies are more likely to pass meconium when:   
   
   
- They've had a long or hard delivery.   
- They are born past their due date.   
- The mother has a health problem, like [diabetes](https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/gestational-diabetes.html) or [high blood pressure](https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/hypertension.html).   
- The mother [smoked](https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/preg-smoking.html) or used drugs during the pregnancy.   
- They [didn't grow well](https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/iugr.html) before birth.
