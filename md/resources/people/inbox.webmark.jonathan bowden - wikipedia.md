> ## Excerpt   
> Jonathan David Anthony Bowden (12 April 1962 â€“ 29 March 2012) was an English painter, novelist, essayist, playwright, actor, orator and activist. Initially a Conservative, he later became involved in far-right organisations such as the British National Party. Bowden has been described as a "cult Internet figure" in the alt-right, even after his death.
