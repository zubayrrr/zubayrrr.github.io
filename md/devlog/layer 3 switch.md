- If you combine a [router](../devlog/router.md) and a [Switch](../devlog/switch.md) you get a Layer 3 Switch   
- It is a device used to connect multiple network segments together   
- Can make Layer 3 routing decisions and interconnect entire networks (like a [router](../devlog/router.md)), not just network segments (like a [Switch](../devlog/switch.md))   
- ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zubayrrr/twiki/main/bin/image.zapt16jgiw.png)   
- Each of their port acts a [Broadcast Domains](/not_created.md) and a [Collision Domains](../devlog/collision%20domains.md).   
- A very efficient device for an internal network.   
- If you've a large network a Layer 3 Switch is not recommended as they're not as efficient at routing as a dedicated [router](../devlog/router.md) would be.
