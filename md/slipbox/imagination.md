- Among the six different types of Humans that have existed, Homo Sapiens survived because of our [Prefrontal cortex](/not_created.md), which basically allows us to think more complexly.   
- Being able to think more complexly allowed us to organize, cultivate, teach, practice, ponder, habituate and create a world more suited for our survival.   
- Because of our ability to "imagine", we were able to build Earth as it is today out of virtually nothing. (Imagine making a computer out of dust, imagine making a rock think.)   
- Thoughts create reality is more than just a nice idea, it's a fact of evolution. It was through language and thought we were able to create a world inside our minds and ultimately, "manifest" it in the outside world (society).
