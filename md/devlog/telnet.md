- TELNET came out before [ssh](../devlog/ssh.md)   
- TELNET does what [ssh](../devlog/ssh.md) does but insecurely, it doesn't encrypt the data transferred.   
- Operates on Port 23   
- Provides bidirectional interactive text-oriented communication facility using a virtual terminal connection. (Remote access via Command Line/Terminal)
