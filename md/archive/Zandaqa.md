> Zindīq (pl. zanādiqa) is a medieval Islamic term applied by Muslims to individuals who are considered to hold views or follow practices that are contrary to central Islamic dogmas. **Zandaqa** is the noun describing these views.Zanadiqa is usually translated as "heresy" and often used to "underscore the seriousness" of the religious error of the accused Muslim. It originally referred to the Manichaean Religion, but "soon came" to be applied to Muslims who concealed their deviant beliefs.
