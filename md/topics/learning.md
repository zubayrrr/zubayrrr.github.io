**Sentence mining**   
   
Sentence mining is about gathering up example sentences and studying them. More specifically, the idea of sentence mining encourages you to focus on sentences as your primary learning material instead of words, lessons or other units of learning.   
   
When studying vocabulary, you use full sentences that contain that vocabulary. Ideally you use several different sentences that all cover the same vocabulary to build a better mental model of how those words behave in the language.   
   
Sentence mining is such an effective technique because it recognises the holistic nature of languages as a form of knowledge.   
   
When you learn with sentences, you're getting a series of complete learning packages. Sentences demonstrate the associations between the words they contain (collocation), they show how the words relate to the grammar and structure of the sentence, and they dramatically increase your opportunities to link your language knowledge together.

**We learn best through compelling, comprehensible input**   
   
   
- **Compelling** — What I learn must be interesting and relevant to me, or else I’ll quit.   
- **Comprehensible** — I must understand (not 100%, but the main idea), or else the language is nonsense, and I’ll quit. I can use context and my previous experiences to help me understand.   
- **Input** — I learn best through stories. Facts are boring. The key is to listen and read things I care about. Memorizing grammar rules and vocabulary isn’t effective.   
   
**Accents depend on emotions**   
   
**Studying a language doesn’t work, acquiring does**   
   
> “We acquire language in only one way. When we understand what people say and when we understand what we read.   
>   
> If you do that, all the grammar and vocabulary you’re ready to acquire is there, and little by little, it’s absorbed.   
>   
> The ability to speak is the result of listening, the result of reading.   
>   
> Study doesn’t help you very much.   
>   
> Memorizing vocabulary rules, vocabulary… studying grammar… if you want to get better at another language, listen and read.   
>   
> Find things you’re really interested in, where you’re excited to know what’s going to happen next, and be patient, it comes over time.   
>   
> We are born to acquire language. That’s the way our brains are.”

## Spotlight VS Floodlight learning   
   
At a personal, organizational, and societal level, we tend to focus on and value “spotlight” learning much more highly than “floodlight” learning.  The spotlight perspective dominates the world of degrees, certifications, and even much of the self-help literature that claims to carve out alternate paths.  There’s nothing surprising or even necessarily wrong with the bias towards the spotlight – things tend to be easier to see, understand, and manage in the spotlight.   
   
But being aware of and regularly tuning into floodlight learning is increasingly important in a world where we are bombarded daily with information and influences, where we have a bewildering array of choices about how and with whom we interact (for example, in social networks).  So much of learning is driven by context and circumstances – whether we choose them or they are thrust upon us, but we don’t often think critically about our context and circumstances.  We often learn on “auto-pilot” – not unlike how we often drive on auto-pilot. That may be fine, in most cases, but among other possible dangers it can cause us to gravitate  toward what is familiar, comfortable, easy – towards a state in which little significant learning is happening at all.   
   
Focus, concentrate, set goals – let your spotlight shine bright. But occasionally peer out into the floodlight and make sure you like what you see. — via [How does your learning light shine? - Mission to Learn - Lifelong Learning Blog](https://www.missiontolearn.com/spotlight-floodlight-alan-watts/)
