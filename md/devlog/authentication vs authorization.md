## Authentication or AuthN   
   
**Authentication verifies the identity of a user or service**   
   
**_Identity management_** confirms that you are you by authenticating and storing information about you. An identity management database holds information about your identity – for example, your job title, stream and authenticates that you are, indeed, the person described in the database.   
   
## Authorization or AuthZ   
   
**Authorization determines their access rights**   
   
**_Access management_** uses the info about your identity to determine which resources you’re allowed access to and what you’re allowed to do when you access them. For example, access management will ensure that every employee within the Finance group has access to all related apps for payment processing and data analysis, but not so much access that they can do confidential banking.
