- What caused the problem symptoms?   
- There could be more than one probable cause; prioritize by likelihood.   
- In case of inability to list probable causes, escalate when you don't have the knowledge, expertise to deal with that particular issue.   
- Don't forget to consider the obvious.   
- Consult internal/external knowledge base.
