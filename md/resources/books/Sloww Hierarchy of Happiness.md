## How to be Happy Externally   
   
By “external,” I mean factors that are outside yourself. We’ll be taking a look at [money](../../topics/money.md), [simplicity](../../topics/simplicity.md), [relationships](../../topics/relationships.md), and [culture](../../topics/culture.md).   
   
## Sloww Hierarchy of Happiness — Money   
   
Happiness can be “bought” up to a point (aim for the ever-elusive enough)   
   
Having too little or too much money can have negative effects.   
   
> Happiness is a place between too little and too much. — Finnish Proverb   
   
Money only affects emotional well-being (happiness) up to an annual   
income of $60,000-$75,000.   
   
At $40K, health, relationships, and purpose become more important. Around $50K, more income had no relationship with day-to-day happiness   
   
> Once a person or family reaches a moderate level of income, here are the factors that research has shown contribute most to happiness: good health, personal growth, strong social relationships, service to others, connection with nature. — Duane Elgin   
   
Why doesn’t more money keep buying us more happiness? The   
answer may be related to the [hedonic treadmill](../../archive/hedonic%20treadmill.md) (or hedonic adaptation):   
   
The hedonic treadmill, also known as hedonic adaptation, is the observed   
tendency of humans to quickly return to a relatively stable level   
of happiness despite major positive or negative events or life   
changes. According to this theory, as a person makes more money, expectations and desires rise in tandem, which results in no permanent gain in happiness...   
   
Hedonic adaptation is a process or mechanism that reduces the affective impact of emotional events. Generally, hedonic adaptation involves a happiness ‘set point’, whereby humans generally maintain a constant level of   
happiness throughout their lives, despite events that occur in their   
environment. The process of hedonic adaptation is often conceptualized as a   
treadmill, since one must continually work to maintain a certain level of happiness.   
   
Others conceptualize hedonic adaptation as functioning similarly to a thermostat (a negative feedback system) that works to maintain an individual’s happiness set point.   
   
> If you worship money and things — if they are where you tap real meaning in life — then you will never have enough. Never feel you have enough ... On one level, we all know this stuff already ... The trick is keeping the truth up-front in daily [consciousness](../../topics/consciousness.md). — [David Foster Wallace](../../resources/people/David%20Foster%20Wallace.md), This is Water   
   
> People who live far below their means enjoy a freedom that people busy upgrading their lifestyles can’t fathom. — [Naval Ravikant](/not_created.md)   
   
> For too long we have been dreaming a dream from which we are now waking up: the dream that if we just improve the socioeconomic situation of people, everything will be okay, people will become happy. The truth is that as the struggle for survival has subsided, the question has emerged: survival for what? Ever more people today have the means to live, but no meaning to live for. — [Viktor Frankl](/not_created.md)   
   
   
   
## Sloww Hierarchy of Happiness — Simplicity   
   
**Simplicity of possessions**   
   
> Most smart people over time realize that possessions don’t make them happy. You have to go through that ... As you get older, you just realize that there’s no happiness in material possessions. — [Naval Ravikant](/not_created.md)   
   
> I can think of no greater happiness in life than to be surrounded only by the things I love. How about you? — [Marie Kondo](/not_created.md), The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up   
   
> Everyone started out a minimalist. Our worth is not the sum of our belongings. Possessions can make us happy only for brief periods. Unnecessary material objects suck up our time, our energy, and our freedom. — [Fumio Sasaki](/not_created.md), Goodbye, Things   
   
> Appoint certain days on which to give up everything and make yourself at home with next to nothing ... For no one is worthy of god unless he has paid no heed to riches. I am not, mind you, against your possessing them, but I want to ensure that you possess them without tremors; and this you will only achieve in one way, by convincing yourself that you can live a happy life even without them, and by always regarding them as being on the point of vanishing. — Seneca   
   
**Simplicity of life**   
   
> A quiet and modest life brings more joy than a pursuit of success bound with constant unrest. — Einstein   
   
> May I not also say that the simplest pleasures are the most enduring, the commonest delights are the most invigorating, the form of happiness which is the most easily available is the best? The further we stray from Nature the harder are we to please, and he knows the truest pleasure who can find it in the simplest forms. — W. J. Dawson   
   
> We need examples of people who, leaving to Heaven to decide whether they are to rise in the world, decide for themselves that they will be happy in it, and have resolved to seek—not greater wealth, but simpler pleasure, not higher fortune, but deeper felicity; making the first of possessions, self-possession. — Ruskin   
   
> Happiness is simple pleasures, is spending time doing what you love and spending time with those you love. — Leo Babauta   
   
> A monastic life is characterized by simple beauty and unexpected joy. Monks find happiness in things that may seem trivial to those who pursue the material trappings of success. Watching the seasons change—the blossoming of the magnolias, the dazzling fall foliage, the first snowfall—brings indescribable joy and gratitude. — Haemin Sunim, The Things You Can See Only When You Slow Down   
   
> The technologist and psychologist Sep Kamvar ran a bit of a social experiment ... and found that young people and old people define happiness in distinct ways. Young people tend to speak about happiness in terms of excitement. Older people tend to speak about happiness in terms of peacefulness. For young people, happiness was accomplishment. For their elders, it was contentment. — Ryan Holiday, Stillness is the Key   
   
> In the 1980s, simplicity was seen primarily as ‘downshifting,’ or pulling back from the rat race of consumer society. Several decades later, there is a growing recognition of simplicity as ‘upshifting’ — or moving beyond the rat race to the human race. Increasingly, the mainstream media and society are recognizing how people’s search for happiness is taking them beyond consumerism to a more balanced and integrated approach to living. — Duane Elgin   
   
   
   
## Sloww Hierarchy of Happiness – Relationships   
   
> The first is that social connections are really good for us, and that loneliness kills. It turns out that people who are more socially connected to family, to friends, to community, are happier, they’re physically healthier, and they live longer than people who are less well connected ... And we know that you can be lonely in a crowd and you can be lonely in a marriage, so the second big lesson that we learned is that it’s not just the number of friends you have, and it’s not whether or not you’re in a committed relationship, but it’s the quality of your close relationships that matters ... And the third big lesson that we learned about relationships and our health is that good relationships don’t just protect our bodies, they protect our brains.   
   
> Emotional happiness is primarily social ... The very best thing that can happen to people is to spend time with other people they like. That is when they are happiest. — Dr. Daniel Kahneman   
   
> One of the best ways to make yourself happy is to make other people happy; one of the best ways to make other people happy is to be happy yourself. — Gretchen Rubin   
   
   
   
   
## Sloww Hierarchy of Happiness – Culture   
   
See also:: [hygge](/not_created.md), [niksen](/not_created.md), and [ikigai](../../archive/ikigai.md)    
   
> Perhaps Danish happiness is not really happiness at all, but something much more valuable and durable: contentedness, being satisfied with your lot, low-level needs being met, higher expectations being kept in check.

> A man is not rightly conditioned until he is a happy, healthy, and prosperous being; and happiness, health, and prosperity are the result of a harmonious adjustment of the inner with the outer... — James Allen, As a Man Thinketh   
   
> The essence of philosophy ... happiness shall depend as little as possible on external things. — [Epictetus](../../resources/people/epictetus.md)   
   
> So if you want to live, you must have no permanent abode. You must have no place to rest your head. You have to flow with it. As the great Confucius said, ‘The one who would be constant in happiness must frequently change.’ Flow. — Anthony de Mello, Awareness   
   
## Sloww Hierarchy of Happiness – Expectations   
   
Mo Gawdat’s tip on happiness:    
   
The way we think about the events of our life and compare them to   
realistic expectations is what makes us happy or unhappy.   
   
> Happiness is very much like staying fit. You start with the decision that you are going to get fit, you find out how – but knowing that is not enough, you have to go to the gym to work out and eat healthily. To me the whole topic of happiness is exactly the same. First you understand that happiness is a choice, that you can actually achieve it and that there is a method to make it happen. Happiness is not a coincidence, it is not given to you by life, it’s entirely our responsibility.   
   
## Sloww Hierarchy of Happiness – Practice   
   
> I’d always believed that a life of quality, enjoyment, and wisdom were my human birthright ... I never suspected that I would have to learn how to live ... ways of seeing the world I had to master before I could awaken to a simple, happy, uncomplicated life. — Dan Millman   
   
Practice until it becomes second nature.   
   
> In every moment, in everything that happens, you can look on the bright side of something. So I used to do that forcibly and then I trained it until it became second nature. — Naval Ravikant   
   
## Sloww Hierarchy of Happiness – Choice   
   
> If you want to be happy, be. — Leo Tolstoy   
   
> Happiness is also a choice. If you’re so smart, how come you aren’t happy? How come you haven’t figured that out? That’s my challenge to all the people who think they’re so smart and so capable. — Naval Ravikant   
   
> Happiness is a choice. You are as happy as you choose to be. If you don’t know how to be happy with what you have, you will never be happy with more. — Rick Warren, The Purpose Driven Life   
   
> The happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts. — Marcus Aurelius   
   
> Individuals who understand what brings them joy and happiness tend to have what we like to call the Right Outlook. They are engulfed in activities and communities that allow them to immerse themselves in a rewarding and gratifying environment.   
   
## Sloww Hierarchy of Happiness – Purpose   
   
**Happiness is a byproduct of finding meaning and purpose**   
   
> I’ve learned that there is nothing more consistent with unhappiness than spending your time in a way that doesn’t serve who you are ... there is no more profound source of fulfillment and happiness than knowing you are traveling your own path... — Scott Dinsmore   
   
> ‘Years of research on the psychology of well-being have demonstrated that often human beings are happiest when they are engaged in meaningful pursuits and virtuous activities.’ Indeed, when we are deeply engaged in an activity that is in accordance with our best self, we often report the highest levels of life satisfaction. — Scientific American   
   
> Very few follow the path laid out for them—the path to their Personal Legends, and to happiness. — Paulo Coelho   
   
> Happiness cannot be pursued; it must ensue. One must have a reason to ‘be happy.’ Once the reason is found, however, one becomes happy automatically. As we see, a human being is not one in pursuit of happiness but rather in search of a reason to become happy, last but not least, through actualizing the potential meaning inherent and dormant in a given situation.— [Viktor Frankl](/not_created.md), Man’s Search for Meaning   
   
> Pleasure is, and must remain, a side-effect or by-product, and is destroyed and spoiled to the degree to which it is made a goal in itself. — [Viktor Frankl](/not_created.md)   
   
> Once an individual’s search for a meaning is successful, it not only renders him happy but also gives him the capability to cope with suffering. — [Viktor Frankl](/not_created.md)   
   
> The difference between happiness and fulfillment is the difference between liking something and loving something ... Happiness comes from what we do. Fulfillment comes from why we do it. — [Simon Sinek](/not_created.md)   
   
Instead of making happiness the goal, focus on meaning and purpose.   
   
> Many persons have a wrong idea of what constitutes true happiness. It is not attained through self-gratification but through fidelity to a worthy purpose. — Helen Keller   
   
> Our deepest happiness in life stems from fulfilling purpose. Doing the best we can, where we are, with what we’ve been given is the best way to live a life of meaning and significance. — Joshua Becker   
   
Think of it like your system or process or a journey   
   
> When you fall in love with the process rather than the product, you don’t have to wait to give yourself permission to be happy. You can be satisfied anytime your system is running. — James Clear, Atomic Habits   
   
   
   
The happiest people are not the ones who achieve the most. They are the ones   
who spend more time than others in a state of flow. — Héctor García and   
Francesc Miralles, Ikigai: The Japanese Secret to a Long and Healthy Life   
Artists, for example, who carry the torch of their ikigai instead of retiring, have this   
power. Art, in all its forms, is an ikigai that can bring happiness and   
purpose to our days. Enjoying or creating beauty is free, and something all   
human beings have access to. — Héctor García and Francesc Miralles   
   
   
   
## Sloww Hierarchy of Happiness – Spirituality    
   
> Happiness cannot be traveled to, owned, earned, worn or consumed. Happiness is the spiritual experience of living every minute with love, grace, and gratitude. — Denis Waitley   
   
> All living beings desire to be happy always, without any misery. In everyone there is observed supreme love for oneself. And happiness alone is the cause of love. In order therefore, to gain that happiness which is one’s nature and which is experienced in the state of deep sleep, where there is no mind, one should know oneself. To achieve this, the Path of Knowledge, the enquiry in the form of ‘Who am I?’, is the principal means. — [Ramana Maharshi](/not_created.md)   
   
> One of the ancient names for God in the yogic tradition is Satchitananda— Eternal, Conscious Bliss. God is ecstasy. God is as high as it gets. If you want to be close to [God](../../topics/god.md), learn to be joyful. If you remain spontaneously happy and centered, no matter what happens, you will find God. — Michael Singer   
   
> Many people may doubt that finding God is the purpose of life; but everyone can accept the idea that the purpose of life is to find happiness. I say that God is Happiness. He is Bliss. He is Love. He is Joy that will never go away from your soul. So why shouldn’t you try to acquire that Happiness? No one else can give it to you. You must continuously cultivate it yourself. — Paramahansa Yogananda   
   
> The joy of Being, which is the only true happiness, can not come to you through any form, possession, achievement, person, or event – through anything that happens. That joy cannot come to you – ever. It emanates form the formless dimension within you, from consciousness itself and thus is one with who you are. — Eckhart Tolle
   
   
## Sloww Hierarchy of Happiness – Presence    
   
> Do you want to be happy? Uninterrupted happiness is uncaused. True happiness is uncaused. You cannot make me happy. You are not my happiness. You say to the awakened person, ‘Why are you happy?’ and the awakened person replies, ‘Why not?’ Happiness is our natural state. — Anthony de Mello   
   
> Happiness is a default state. It’s what’s there when you remove the sense that something is missing from your life. — Naval Ravikant   
   
> Wakefulness, happiness—call it what you wish—is the state of nondelusion, where you see things not as you are but as they are, insofar as this is possible for a human being. — Anthony de Mello   
   
> Don’t seek happiness. If you seek it, you won’t find it, because seeking is the antithesis of happiness. Happiness is ever elusive, but freedom from unhappiness is attainable now, by facing what is rather than making up stories about it. Unhappiness covers up your natural state of wellbeing and inner peace, the source of true happiness. — Eckhart Tolle   
   
> You become happy by contact with [reality](../../topics/reality.md). That’s what brings happiness, a moment-by-moment contact with reality. That’s where you’ll find God; that’s where you’ll find happiness. — Anthony de Mello   
   
> You are present when what you are doing is not primarily a means to an end (money, prestige, winning) but fulfilling in itself, when there is joy and aliveness in what you do. And, of course, you cannot be present unless you become friendly with the present moment. — Eckhart Tolle   
   
> I don’t live in either my past or my future. I’m interested only in the present. If you can concentrate always on the present, you’ll be a happy man ... Life will be a party for you, a grand festival, because life is the moment we’re living right now. — Paulo Coelho   
   
> Peace is happiness at rest, and happiness is peace in motion. You can convert peace to happiness any time you want, but peace is want you want most of the time ... If you’re a peaceful person, anything you do will be a happy activity. — Naval Ravikant
   
   
##  Sloww Hierarchy of Happiness – Desire   
   
> Nothing can satisfy the ego for long. As long as it runs your life, there are two ways of being unhappy. Not getting what you want is one. Getting what you want is the other. — Eckhart Tolle   
   
> Desire to me is a contract that you make with yourself to be unhappy until you get what you want. — Naval Ravikant   
   
> Don’t seek that all that comes about should come about as you wish, but wish that everything that comes about should come about just as it does, and then you’ll have a calm and happy life. — [Epictetus](../../resources/people/epictetus.md), Enchiridion   
   
> On the whole, the happiest people seem to be those who have no particular cause for being happy except that they are so. — William R. Inge   
   
> We need to start by understanding that true happiness is not reflected in the modern world’s view of it being fun, elation or laughter. Happiness is finding peace and being OK with life exactly as it is. — Mo Gawdat   
   
> You can experience a life in which waves of love can rush up inside of you any time you want. It is the nature of your being. You simply have to go to the other side of the psyche. You do that by letting go of the tendency to cling. You do it by not using your mind to build false solidity. You just decide, once and for all, to take the journey by constantly letting go. — Michael Singer   
   
> “Nietzsche, in a rare moment of deep stillness, wrote, “For happiness, how little suffices for happiness!…the least thing precisely, the gentlest thing, the lightest thing, a lizard’s rustling, a breath, a wisk, an eye glance—little maketh up the best happiness. Be still.” ― Eckhart Tolle, A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life's Purpose   
   
> Happiness is the very nature of the Self; happiness and the Self are not different. There is no happiness in any object of the world. We imagine through our ignorance that we derive happiness from objects. When the mind goes out, it experiences misery. In truth, when its desires are fulfilled, it returns to its own place and enjoys the happiness that is the Self. Similarly, in the states of sleep, samadhi and fainting, and when the object desired is obtained or the object disliked is removed, the mind becomes inward-turned, and enjoys pure Self-Happiness. — [Ramana Maharshi](/not_created.md)   
   
> Basic needs and metaneeds are in the same hierarchical-integration, i.e., in the same continuum, in the same realm of discourse. They have the same basic characteristic of being ‘needed’ (necessary, good for the person) in the sense that their deprivation produces ‘illness’ and diminution, and that their ‘ingestion’ fosters growth toward full humanness, toward greater happiness and joy, toward psychological ‘success,’ toward more peak experiences, and in general toward living more often at the level of being. That is, they are all biologically desirable, and all foster biological success. — [Abraham Maslow](/not_created.md)   
   
   
   
## Sloww Hierarchy of Happiness – Transcendence   
   
What happens when life is no longer all about you?   
   
> ‘The self-transcendence of human existence’ ... being human always points, and is directed, to something, or someone, other than oneself—be it a meaning to fulfill or another human being to encounter. The more one forgets himself—by giving himself to a cause to serve or another person to love—the more human he is and the more he actualizes himself ... self-actualization is possible only as a side-effect of self-transcendence. — Viktor Frankl   
   
> There are three words that convey the secret of the art of living, the secret of all success and happiness: One With Life. Being one with life is being one with [Now](../../topics/Now.md). You then realize that you don’t live your life, but life lives you. Life is the dancer, and you are the dance. — Eckhart Tolle   
   
> For unenlightened people, not every day is a good day, because they feel happy only when things happen the way they want them to. For enlightened people, every single day is a good day, because they feel free knowing that nothing can take away their wisdom. — Haemin Sunim   
   
> As you identify less and less with the ‘[I](../../topics/self.md)’, you will be more at ease with everybody and with everything. Do you know why? Because you are no longer afraid of being hurt or not liked. You no longer desire to impress anyone. Can you imagine the relief when you don’t have to impress anybody anymore? Oh, what a relief. Happiness at last! — Anthony de Mello   
   
> What is called the world is only thought. When the world disappears, i.e., when there is no thought, the mind experiences happiness; and when the world appears, it goes through misery. — Ramana Maharshi   
   
> Once you have passed through trial by fire, and you are thoroughly convinced that you will let go no matter what, then the veils of the human mind and heart will fall away. You will stand face-to-face with what is beyond you because there is no longer a need for you. When you are done playing with the temporal and finite, you will open to the eternal and infinite. Then the word ‘happiness’ can’t describe your state. That’s where words like ecstasy, bliss, liberation, [Nirvana](/not_created.md), and freedom come in. The joy becomes overwhelming, and your cup runneth over. — Michael Singer   
   
> The term peak experiences is a generalization for the best moments of the human being, for the happiest moments of life, for experiences of ecstasy, rapture, bliss, of the greatest joy. I found that such experiences came from profound aesthetic experiences such as creative ecstasies, moments of mature love, perfect sexual experiences, parental love, experiences of natural childbirth, and many others. I use the term—peak experiences—as a kind of generalized and abstract concept because I discovered that all of these ecstatic experiences had some characteristics in common. — Abraham Maslow, The Farther Reaches of Human Nature
