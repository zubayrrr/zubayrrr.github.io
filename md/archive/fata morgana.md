> A Fata Morgana is a complex form of superior mirage visible in a narrow band right above the horizon. The Italian term Fata Morgana translates the name of the Arthurian sorceress Morgan le Fay ("Morgan the Fairy"), due to a belief that these mirages, often seen in the Strait of Messina, were fairy castles in the air or false land conjured up by her witchcraft to lure sailors to their deaths.â€”via [Fata Morgana (mirage) - Wikipedia](<[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fata_Morgana_(mirage)>)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fata_Morgana_(mirage)>))
