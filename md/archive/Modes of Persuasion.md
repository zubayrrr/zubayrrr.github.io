Ethos, pathos, and logos are referred to as the three modes of persuasion.   
   
   
- Ethos is a way of convincing your audience of your **credibility** as a writer. Some credibility can be, in a way, built-in. Level of education in relation to the topic may provide some built-in ethos.   
- Most simply, pathos is the appeal to our human **emotions**. We’re more often moved by our emotions than by logic or common sense, so pathos is a powerful mode of persuasion.   
- Logos is the appeal to our **logical** side. Logos is about the facts we present in our writing and the logical manner in which we present our ideas.
