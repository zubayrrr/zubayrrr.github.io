Operational Data Stores   
   
   
- Just like a [data warehouse](../devlog/data%20warehouse.md) an ODS integreates data from multiple sources.   
- Unlike a Data Warehouse, an ODS primarily focus on <span class="underline">current</span> operational data   
- Often real-time data feeds from source applications are sent to an ODS, unlike batch oriented ETL feeds of a Data Warehouse.   
- They're less popular now   
- A lot of ODSes have been superseded by [Big Data](../devlog/big%20data.md) Technologies   
- ODS components can be found within [Data Lake](/not_created.md)s   
- "Traditional" ODSs still sometimes are used for mission critical situations
