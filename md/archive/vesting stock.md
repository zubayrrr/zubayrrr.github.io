In employee compensation, vesting stock refers to shares held by an employee that were granted either through employee stock options (ESOs) or restricted stock units (RSUs), that is not yet earned by the employee. Vesting is a legal term that means the point in time where property is earned or gained by some person.   
   
In practical terms, many employers grant stock options or restricted stock as part of their compensation plans that are accompanied with vesting schedules, which means the employee needs to hit certain achievements in order to gain the right to own the shares.   
   
   
-   **Employee Stock Options (ESOs)** : For ESOs, when stock becomes fully vested, the employee has earned the right to an option to purchase the shares that were granted to them in the past.   
-   **Restricted Stock Units (RSUs)** : For RSUs, when stock becomes fully vested, the employee has earned the ownership of the shares outright.
