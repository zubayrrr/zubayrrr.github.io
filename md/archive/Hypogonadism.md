Hypogonadism in a man refers to a decrease in one or both of the two major functions of the testes: sperm production and testosterone production. These abnormalities usually result from **disease of the testes** (primary hypogonadism) or disease of the pituitary or hypothalamus (secondary hypogonadism).
