title: Create a Budget
updated: 1664915896224

- Create a budget in [aws.budgets](/not_created.md)   
  - Create a cost budget   
  - Make the budget monthly, with a fixed cost you are comfortable with (I usually put $5)   
  - Set the threshold to "Forecasted Cost" at 100%   
  - Use an email address you often use so you'll see the budget alert email

> 1. Activate the IAM User and Role Access to Billing Information setting in the Billing and Cost Management console. If you haven't enabled this setting, then your IAM users and roles can't access the Billing and Cost Management console, even if they have admin permissions and the required IAM policies in place. Because this setting is disabled by default, it must be manually activated by the root user. For more information on activating this setting, see Granting access to your billing information and tools. — via [Allow an IAM user to view my account's billing information](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/iam-billing-access/)
