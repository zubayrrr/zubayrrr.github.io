Anything that makes you dependent on it is bad for you. These can be people, substances etc. They either limit you or make it unsustainable for you to continue without them.   
   
Examples:   
   
   
- Waiting for a gym buddy to start working out?   
	- Taking days off when your gym buddy doesn’t go to the gym?   
- Caffeine   
	- Can’t focus without drinking coffee?   
- Nicotine   
   
Always try to rely on yourself.    
   
> There is nothing worse than feeling dependent on other people. Dependency makes you vulnerable to all kinds of emotions—betrayal, disappointment, frustration—that play havoc with your mental balance. via — [Tweet link](https://twitter.com/RobertGreene/status/1564357240764579841)
