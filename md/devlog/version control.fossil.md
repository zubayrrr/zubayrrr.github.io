## [version control.git](../devlog/version%20control.git.md) VS Fossil   
   
Git provides file versioning services only, whereas Fossil adds an integrated wiki, ticketing & bug tracking, embedded documentation, technical notes, a web forum, and a chat service, all within a single nicely-designed skinnable web UI, protected by a fine-grained role-based access control system.
