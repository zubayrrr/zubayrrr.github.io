GitOps refers to an emerging set of principles, practices and tools which help you build an operational framework for cloud native applications primarily running on Kubernetes. It offers not only a developer-centric approach to deploy applications, but also brings in the familiar and effective workflows built around Git to the operations fold, such as rolling out with pull requests and rollbacks with git reverts.   
   
GitOps provides a simple, fast, yet secure way to run operational activities on platforms such as Kubernetes, including continuous delivery, rolling out infrastructure components and policies, and a quick remediation in case of failure.
