Sassafras is a hallucinogen that’s also known as methylenedioxyamphetamine ([MDA](/not_created.md)). You might also hear it called sass or sally.   
   
It’s derived from the oil of the sassafras plant. This oil, called safrole, can be used to make MDA. MDA causes your brain to release more chemicals called neutrotransmitters, which produces the high.   
   
Some people consider it a gentler version of molly, but that’s not exactly accurate (more on this later).   
   
Sassafras causes your brain to release the chemicals:   
   
   
- serotonin   
- dopamine   
- norepinephrine   
   
Together, these chemicals have a few different effects.   
   
In addition to feelings of closeness and empathy, Sassafras can also cause:   
   
   
- euphoria or extreme pleasure   
- excitement   
- increased energy   
- confidence   
   
Sassafras usually comes in pill form. It can also be found in capsules or as a white powder that can be consumed or sniffed.   
   
Not all batches of this drug are exactly the same and can vary depending on the source.   
   
Ingredients can also vary, even if you think you’re getting “pure” sassafras. As with other drugs, pills or powder are sometimes cut with other toxic chemicals.   
   
MDA is actually a minor metabolite of molly. In fact, commonly used molly tests, including the Marquis reagent, can’t differentiate between the two. They also cost about the same. Sassafras is sometimes sold as molly, too.   
   
A sassafras high can last from 8 to 12 hours, depending on the dose. The aftereffects, or “comedown,” tend to last about an hour.   
   
Keep in mind that most people describe the comedown as not being very pleasant. Feelings of fatigue and depression are common and can linger for a few days.   
   
Methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA) is a ring-substituted derivative of amphetamine and is a member of the group of drugs popularly known as “Ecstacy” which also includes methylenedioxymethylamphetamine ([MDMA](../archive/MDMA.md)) and methylenedioxyethylamphetamine (MDEA).
