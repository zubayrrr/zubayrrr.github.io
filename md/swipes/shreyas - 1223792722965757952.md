Hey PMs &amp; tech leaders, here’s a recording of my talk:   
   
"The 7 Myths That Stymie PM Impact (&amp; Careers)"   
   
[youtube.com/watch?v=jLH9xa…](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLH9xaerIB0)    
   
It covers some topics that don't get enough coverage, including:   
   
Money vs Title   
   
Confidence vs Competence   
   
Problem Prevention (&amp; pre-mortems)   
   
Thread 👇🏾

Some of these 7 ideas are quite radical, others less so.   
   
And they are not for everyone.   
   
But I hope that they will inspire further reflection.   
   
You'll also see slightly unconventional book recommendations for PMs and product leaders in general. [pic.twitter.com/b2TsGSKeav](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1223792859469320192/photo/1)

PMs should definitely utilize their strengths, but they will have a greater impact and become better product leaders if they also address their weaknesses.

3rd:    
   
You can increase your impact on the organization (and reduce the tremendous stress that often accompanies the PM job) by avoiding the trap of doing a great job on all tasks (and even features). Seek leverage, actively try to do a bad job for certain tasks.    
   
What!!??   
   
Yes.

A similar concept can also be applied to product features.   
   
Be intentional about what type of feature you're trying to build in a given context.   
   
Chiefly, once everyone's on the same page on the quality level you're aiming for, you can more rigorously resolve disagreements. [pic.twitter.com/AQzkpy9Iy7](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1223832383964639232/photo/1)

The most useful part of the Agreed Target Quality framework is the common lexicon. It works wonders when Eng–Design–PM are all aligned on the target quality for a given milestone.

Becoming VP Product / CPO / COO / etc. isn't the only path for high-performing PMs. And it might even be a terrible path for some. So, don't just chase the big title.   
   
And remember one key thing:    
   
Title and Money are not as correlated as you might think.

Pride in one's logical &amp; analytical thinking can create major blind-spots for PMs and product leaders. You must understand the psychological factors that will influence your users' and customers' behavior. This applies to consumer products AND to enterprise products.

At this point, we get to the part of the talk where I leave exercises for the audience (and for you here).   
   
If you are a PM (or if work on products in almost any capacity), you must read "Alchemy" by [@rorysutherland](https://twitter.com/rorysutherland).

In "Super Thinking", Lauren McCann and [@yegg](https://twitter.com/yegg) describe hundreds of mental models that can help you become a better thinker and decision maker.

"The Art of the Good Life" by [@dobelli](https://twitter.com/dobelli) is one of my top 5 favorite books of all time.   
   
It will make you a better PM and decision-maker (among other things).

Don't assume that "PM-driven" companies are better for PMs. If you care about building superb products, you'll be better off at a company where Eng/Design/others have an *equal* voice in what product gets built. PM-driven companies are good for PMs' egos, but not much else.

The ego feels great when we’re in charge.   
   
But it almost always leads to worse products. When PMs are "calling the shots", largely based on their title, why should others care deeply about the product?   
   
So, seek "product-obsessed companies" and avoid "PM-driven companies".

Speaking of ego, if you want to learn more about shedding your ego and being an even-keeled PM, there’s no better book than “The Practicing Stoic” by Ward Farnsworth.   
   
(another one of my top 5 all-time favorite books, and also unconventional PM book reco)

`{_obsidian_pattern_tag_7}` (last one):   
   
Many Medium posts about product management (and leadership in general) will advise you to be very confident with your team. Decent advice, but it needs to be accompanied with guidance on adequately balancing  confidence with actual competence.

"Fake it till you make it" is regularly doled out as great advice to would-be leaders and executives. If taken very seriously, this advice can have major harmful effects, both on the team/product/company and on the individual who's faking it. (but that's for another Tweetstorm)

Regarding Confidence vs. Competence, I learned something super-valuable here from @StephanieLSoler, my executive coach at Twitter.   
   
As a leader, your level of Confidence should be just *very slightly* above your actual Competence.

Now, onto the book recommendations for this one.    
   
"Mistakes were made (but not by me)" by Carol Tavris and Elliot Aronson reminds us of the countless ways in which we're fallible. Therefore, keep your confidence in check.

"The Charisma Myth" by Olivia Fox Cabane is a splendid book, that among other things, prescribes an authentic path towards building and exuding confidence.
