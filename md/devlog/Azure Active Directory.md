Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) is a cloud-based identity and access management service provided by Microsoft Azure. It is used to manage and authenticate users, groups, and other identities, and to provide secure access to applications and resources in Azure, as well as in on-premises and cloud environments.   
   
Azure AD provides a range of features and capabilities, such as user and group management, multi-factor authentication, and security analytics, to help organizations manage and secure their identities and access to resources. It also offers integration with other Azure services, such as [Azure Security Center](../devlog/Azure%20Security%20Center.md) and [Azure Information Protection](/not_created.md), to provide a comprehensive security solution for Azure workloads.
