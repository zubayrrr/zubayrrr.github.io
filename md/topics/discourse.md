# The Rules of Civil Conversation   
   
## I resolve to:   
   
   
- 1 Try and reach a shared understanding rather than ‘win the argument’.   
- 2 Clarify with others to make sure I genuinely understand their perspective.   
- 3 Endeavor to avoid committing [logical fallacies](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com) in support of my claims.   
- 4 Attempt to account for my own [biases](https://yourbias.is) and try to be intellectually humble.   
- 5 Try to be reasonable, rational, and create coherent arguments.   
- 6 Refrain from personal attacks, sarcasm, and mean-spiritedness.   
- 7 Use the [‘Principle of Charity’](https://ethics.org.au/ethics-explainer-the-principle-of-charity/) to see the merits of others’ points of view in the best light.   
- 8 Remain genuinely receptive to changing my mind if presented with compelling arguments or evidence.
