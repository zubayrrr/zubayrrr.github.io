## Quote(s)   
   
   
- Facebook experienced mass walkouts in the summer of 2020 as staff protested CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s seeming indifference to refereeing inaccurate and divisive political ads on their platform. Atlas, now wearing a hoodie and Allbirds sneakers, just shrugged.   
- By the summer of 2019 a New York Times article declared “Silicon Valley Goes to Therapy” as six-figure tech workers belatedly realized all-you-can-eat arugula and sushi weren’t enough to quell the increasing queasiness they were feeling.   
- Derek Thompson writes in The Atlantic, “commit crimes at historically low rates and have attended college at historically high rates. They have done everything right, sprinting at full speed while staying between the white lines, and their reward for historic conscientiousness is this: less ownership, more debt, and an age of existential catastrophe. . . . Why in the name of family, God, or country would such a person lust for ancient affiliations? As the kids say, \#BurnItAllDown.”   
- While Hitchens pointed his dry wit and commentary toward all kinds of faith, including Buddhism and neo-paganism, Harris took particular issue with Islam and its apparent connection to the violence that had engulfed the world since 9/11. Although each thinker differed in emphasis, they could all agree on one thing: Religion, at its very roots, was a superstitious throwback, doomed to promote suffering and perpetuate ignorance.   
- Believing in virgin births or martyrs’ paradise, or a world divided into the saved and the damned, these skeptics insisted, was incompatible with modernity, common sense, and reason. At best, they argued, it was infantilizing. At worst, it provided justification for all sorts of horror. The time for Blind Faith was up, they agreed. These Four Horsemen of the New Atheism, as they were soon called, were only too happy to celebrate the End of Faith.   
- Those not drawn to the promise of the all-in-one Megachurch don’t always end up where Harris and Hitchens would have imagined—in the realm of reason and rationality. They often drift to the other extreme and fall into nihilism instead. Pew and Gallup don’t survey this particular group of the unchurched and unbelieving. But public health officials do, and their findings are sobering. Diseases of despair—anxiety, depression, suicide—are rampant. One in six Americans takes psychiatric medications just to cope with the banality of modern life. To put this in harsh relief, the World Health Organization reports that more people today kill themselves than die from all wars and natural disasters combined.   
- For sure, Nietzsche was arguing that the reason and logic of the French Enlightenment and scientific revolution had replaced blind faith. But, he said, there are profound social consequences to lobbing the Baby Jesus out with all that backward-ass bathwater. “When one gives up the Christian faith,” Nietzsche cautioned, “one pulls the right to Christian morality out from under one’s feet. This morality is by no means self-evident. . . . Christianity is a system, a whole view of things thought out together. By breaking one main concept out of it, the faith in God, one breaks the whole”   
- Walter Cronkite and BBC Radio no longer define the norms of polite debate and let us know, in soothing tones, that even if all is not right with the world, that right still leads the world.   
- we have to do the heavy lifting and sort through competing and conflicting sources ourselves. That requires graduating from simple, binary, either/or thinking toward both/and/neither thinking. Not only does this require an unusually high tolerance for ambiguity, it requires cultivating what Roger Martin, the dean of the Rotman School of Management, calls an “opposable mind” that can stay above the fray.   
- “We’ll take your vertically integrated supply chains, predatory lending, and profit margins,” said the Chinese Communist Party. “You can keep your uppity citizenry, human rights, and elections.”   
- When twenty-six people, who could all comfortably fit on a bus together (not that they’d ever ride one), own as much wealth as the poorer half of the world (nearly four billion people), you know we’re in a strange place. That sort of asymmetric resource accumulation has never existed in all of human history, or anywhere in nature, for that matter. And it all accrued during an era where democratic, technocratic, “rising tides lift all boats” trickle-down philosophies were the dominant story. It’s not surprising that some of us have lost the plot.   
- Scoff, delay, deflect. Shoot the messengers. Anything other than think the unthinkable. And with the ever present distractions of our algorithmically optimized smartphone lives, denial can take an even more banal path. “And as things fell apart,” the Talking Heads sang presciently, “nobody paid much attention.”   
- We shouldn’t give a fig for the joy on this side of complexity, but we should be willing to give our lives for the joy on the other side of it. And that will require facing all the facts.
