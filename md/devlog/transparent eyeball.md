The **Transparent eyeball** is a philosophical metaphor originated by Ralph Waldo Emerson. The transparent eyeball is a representation of an eye that is absorbent rather than reflective, and therefore takes in all that nature has to offer.  Emerson intends that the individual become one with nature, and the transparent eyeball is a tool to do that. In the essay Nature, Emerson explains that the meaning behind the transparent eyeball is similar to a scientific standpoint on the Bible.
