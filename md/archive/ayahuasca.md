One of its primary effects is considered to be the vomiting (the purge) that accompanies the experience. The term ayahuasca is sometimes loosely used to mean any combination of an [archive.Monoamine oxidase inhibitor](/not_created.md) with [archive.n n-dimethyltryptamine](/not_created.md).

> Traditionally, to make ayahuasca, the B. Caapi is mashed up into a pulp, and added to boiling water. The chacruna leaf is then added to the brew, in order to exert psychoactive effects. The ayahuasca brew leads to a psychedelic journey that lasts for around six hours.  — via [What Is Changa?
