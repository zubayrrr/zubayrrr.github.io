Originally, **Fallibilism** (from Medieval Latin: fallibilis, "liable to err") is the philosophical principle that propositions concerning empirical knowledge can be accepted even though they cannot be proven with certainty, or in short, that no beliefs are certain. The term was coined in the late nineteenth century by the American philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce, as a response to foundationalism. Nowadays, theorists may also refer to fallibilism as the notion that empirical knowledge might turn out to be false. Fallibilism is often juxtaposed with infallibilism.
