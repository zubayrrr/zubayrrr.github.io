Microsoft IIS (Internet Information Services) is a free web server software package for Windows Server. IIS only runs on Windows operating systems.   
   
IIS or Internet Information Server is the server used to host .Net web applications. IIS hosting is normally installed on a Window Server.   
   
For users to access a website, it is required that the website is hosted on some sort of web server. There are different web servers available for different technologies. In .Net, the web server available is called Internet Information Services or IIS.   
   
Once the web application is developed, it is then deployed on an IIS Server. This web application can then be accessed by the end users. There are two ways to deploy an application to the server:   
   
   
- Using the File Copy method.   
- Using the Web publish method.
