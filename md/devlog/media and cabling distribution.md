### Media   
   
   
- [Coax](../devlog/coax.md) is the oldest Copper media   
- [Twisted Pair](../devlog/twisted%20pair.md)   
- [Straight-Through Patch Cable](../devlog/straight-through%20patch%20cable.md)   
- [Crossover Cable](../devlog/crossover%20cable.md)   
- [Pinouts](../devlog/pinouts.md)   
- [Plenum](../devlog/plenum.md) vs [Non-Plenum](../devlog/non-plenum.md)   
- [Building a Cable](../devlog/building%20a%20cable.md)   
- [Fiber Optic](../devlog/fiber%20optic.md)   
- [Fiber Optic vs Copper](../devlog/fiber%20optic%20vs%20copper.md)   
- [Media Converters](../devlog/media%20converters.md)   
- [Transceivers](../devlog/transceivers.md)

### Cable Distribution System   
   
   
- Is an organized system that is hierarchical in nature so we can figure out exactly where cabls should be laid so they're safe, secure and functional.   
- [Punch Down Blocks](../devlog/punch%20down%20blocks.md)   
- [Patch Panels - Copper](../devlog/patch%20panels%20-%20copper.md)   
- [Patch Panels - Fiber](../devlog/patch%20panels%20-%20fiber.md)

### Typical Copper Cable Installation

Gives modularity and [leeway](/not_created.md) to work things out, instead of changing the entire cable.   
   
### Testing the Network   
   
   
- Use a Toner Probe(Fox & Hound) to find which port is tied to the patch panel and also to test the wires of the cable.
