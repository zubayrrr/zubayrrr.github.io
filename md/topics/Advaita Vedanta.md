Advaita Vedanta is a school of Hindu philosophy that emphasizes the idea of non-duality, or the unity of the individual self (atman) with the ultimate reality (Brahman). It is considered one of the classical philosophical systems of India, and its ideas have had a profound influence on Hindu thought. The term "Advaita" comes from the Sanskrit words "a" (not) and "dvaita" (dual), and its central tenet is the idea that there is only one ultimate reality, Brahman, and that the individual self, or atman, is ultimately the same as Brahman.   
   
Advaita Vedanta is a monistic philosophy, meaning it posits that there is only one ultimate reality, Brahman, and that all other things are essentially illusory and temporary. The individual self, or atman, is seen as a temporary manifestation of Brahman, and the goal of the individual is to realize this ultimate unity and become one with Brahman. This realization is known as moksha, or liberation, and is achieved through a combination of self-inquiry, meditation, and the study of scriptures.   
   
One of the key ideas of Advaita Vedanta is the concept of maya, or illusion. According to this philosophy, the world we experience through our senses is not real in the ultimate sense, but is rather an illusion created by the mind. This illusion is caused by our ignorance of the true nature of reality, and it prevents us from realizing our essential unity with Brahman. In order to break free from this illusion, we must develop self-awareness and cultivate a deep understanding of the true nature of reality.   
   
Another important concept in Advaita Vedanta is the idea of karma, or the law of cause and effect. According to this philosophy, our actions have consequences, both in this life and in future lives. Good actions lead to good consequences, while bad actions lead to bad consequences. The ultimate goal of Advaita Vedanta is to break free from the cycle of karma and achieve moksha, or liberation, which is seen as the end of suffering and the attainment of ultimate freedom and bliss.   
   
The founder of Advaita Vedanta is believed to be the ancient Indian sage named Adi Shankara, who lived in the 8th century CE. He wrote extensively on the philosophy, and his works continue to be studied and revered by followers of Advaita Vedanta. Shankara's philosophy was based on the teachings of the Upanishads, a collection of ancient Hindu texts, and he sought to reconcile the ideas of non-duality with the dualistic worldview of the Vedas, the oldest Hindu scriptures.   
   
The Upanishads are a collection of ancient Hindu texts that contain philosophical teachings and ideas about the nature of reality. They are considered to be part of the Vedas, the oldest Hindu scriptures, but are distinct from the rest of the Vedas in their focus on philosophical speculation and contemplation. The Upanishads are known for their emphasis on the idea of non-duality, or the unity of the individual self (atman) with the ultimate reality (Brahman).   
   
Gaudapada was an Indian philosopher who lived in the 6th century CE. He is best known for his commentary on the Mandukya Upanishad, in which he introduced the concept of the substratum (adhisthana) as the ultimate reality. According to Gaudapada, the substratum is the unchanging and eternal ground of being, which underlies and supports the manifest world of change and diversity. It is the ultimate source and support of all things, and the true nature of the self. Gaudapada's concept of the substratum has influenced many later philosophers in India, including Shankara, who developed it further in his Advaita (non-dual) philosophy.
