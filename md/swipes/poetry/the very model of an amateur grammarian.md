I am the very model of an amateur grammarian     
I have a little knowledge and I am authoritarian     
But I make no apology for being doctrinarian     
We must not plummet to the verbal depths of the barbarian   
   
I’d sooner break my heart in two than sunder an infinitive     
And I’d disown my closest family within a minute if     
They dared to place a preposition at a sentence terminus     
Or sully the Queen’s English with neologisms verminous   
   
I know that ‘soon’ and not ‘right now’ is the true sense of ‘presently’     
I’m happy to correct you and I do it oh so pleasantly     
I’m not a grammar Nazi; I’m just a linguistic Aryan     
I am the very model of an amateur grammarian   
   
I’m sure people appreciate my pointing out their grammar gaffes     
And sorting out their sentences and crossing out their paragraphs     
When you crusade for good English, it’s not all doom and gloom you sow     
The secret of success is: it’s not who you know; it’s whom you know   
   
The standards of our language are declining almost every day     
Down from a peak in 18– or 19– I think – well, anyway     
Pop music, TV, blogs and texting are inflicting ravages     
Upon English and unchecked, this will turn us into savages   
   
I fear that sloppy language is a sign of immorality     
For breaking rules of grammar is akin to criminality     
So curse those trendy linguists, lexicographers and anyone     
Who shuns the model English of the amateur grammarian   
   
Conjunctions at the openings of sentences are sickening     
I wish that the decline of the subjunctive were not quickening     
And that more people knew the proper meaning of ‘anticipate’     
Of ‘fulsome’ and ‘enormity’, ‘fortuitous’ and ‘decimate’   
   
I learned these rules at school and of correctness they’re my surety     
I cling to them for safety despite having reached maturity     
Some say that language changes, but good English is immutable     
And so much common usage now is deeply disreputable   
   
My pedantry’s demanding but I try not to feel bitter at     
The fact that everyone I meet is borderline illiterate     
When all around are wrong then I am proud to be contrarian     
I am the very model of an amateur grammarian
