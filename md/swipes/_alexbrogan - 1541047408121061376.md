Jootsing   
   
An extreme version of thinking outside the box that involves:   
   
1) First gaining deep knowledge of the system and its rules   
   
2) Then stepping outside to find something that subverts its rules   
   
3) And finally, using your findings to make something new and creative [pic.twitter.com/gnkZLevfpa](https://twitter.com/_alexbrogan/status/1541047415079424001/photo/1)

Worm's Eye View   
   
Whether you’re a techie, politician, or corporate executive, you can’t fix a problem just by taking a top-down view.    
   
You also need to look at the world bottom-up, through the workers’ eyes.    
   
Be curious like a child and walk in others’ shoes.

[@gilliantett](https://twitter.com/gilliantett) The Happiness Paradox   
   
The more you search for happiness, the more it eludes you.    
   
If you want to be happy, stop thinking about trying to be happy so much.    
   
Happiness is a natural state that it occurs when you accept ‘what is’ and don't desire for anything else.

[@gilliantett](https://twitter.com/gilliantett) Tim Ferriss Discomfort Razor   
   
Your success in life can be measured by the number of uncomfortable conversations you're willing to have.   
   
Growth and comfort don't exist in the same room.    
   
Act accordingly.

[@gilliantett](https://twitter.com/gilliantett) [@tferriss](https://twitter.com/tferriss) The Easterlin Paradox   
   
At a point in time happiness varies directly with income, but over time happiness doesn’t continue growing as income grows.    
   
In other words, you think making more money will make you happier, but you’re wrong.

[@gilliantett](https://twitter.com/gilliantett) [@tferriss](https://twitter.com/tferriss) The Approval Paradox   
   
The more you want someone's approval, the harder it is to get it.   
   
Approval seeking is a sign of insecurity and neediness, both unattractive traits.   
   
“When you're content to simply be yourself and not compare or compete, everyone will respect you.”

[@gilliantett](https://twitter.com/gilliantett) [@tferriss](https://twitter.com/tferriss) Hinge of History   
   
We are part of a time in human history where we’ve never had such a disproportionate influence over our long-term futures.    
   
The threats we face—climate, aging/declining population, space—and technology we build in the next 50 years are the future of humanity.

[@gilliantett](https://twitter.com/gilliantett) [@tferriss](https://twitter.com/tferriss) Legibility   
   
Not everything that can be counted counts, and not everything that counts can be counted.    
   
We are blind to what we cannot measure.    
   
We manage what we can measure, so society repeats the same mistakes.

[@gilliantett](https://twitter.com/gilliantett) [@tferriss](https://twitter.com/tferriss) Creativity Begins at the Edge of Reason   
   
”Change starts away from the spotlight.    
   
Then, it moves towards the center.    
   
That’s why the most interesting ideas at a conference never come from the main stage.    
   
They come from the hallways and the bar after sunset.”

[@gilliantett](https://twitter.com/gilliantett) [@tferriss](https://twitter.com/tferriss) [@scottbelsky](https://twitter.com/scottbelsky) Do Nothing Tendency   
   
We are more bothered by harm that comes from action than harm that comes from inaction, so we default to no action.   
   
"Most of us have two lives: the life we live, and the unlived life within us"— [@SPressfield](https://twitter.com/SPressfield)   
   
Don't resort to no action as a means of comfort.

A type of word used when someone wants to make it seem like they’ve given a clear answer to a question when they’ve actually said something ambiguous or vague.    
   
Weasel words:   
   
• “Fairly”   
   
• “Better”   
   
• ”Probably”   
   
• “Improved”    
   
These words don’t say much.

Risk applies to situations where we don’t know the outcome of a situation but can measure its probabilities.    
   
Uncertainty applies to situations where we can’t even measure probabilities because quantifiable knowledge is unknowable.
