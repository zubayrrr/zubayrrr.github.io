All of the logical topologies under [Wired Network Topology](../devlog/wired%20network%20topology.md) apply to Wireless Network Topologies.   
   
Wireless adds two more layers:   
   
   
- Infrastructure Mode: Uses a wireless access point as a centralized point (like a star) and supports wireless security controls and centralized management.   
- Ad Hoc Mode: Decentralized wireless network which created [Peer-to-{eer](/not_created.md)connections and does not require a router or an access point.   
- Wireless Mesh Topology: Interconnection of different types of nodes, devices, or radios which consists of clients, routers, gateways and other devices (used to create redundant and reliable connections).
