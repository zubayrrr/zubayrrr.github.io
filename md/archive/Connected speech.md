Connected speech is the way in which words are connected and pronounced in natural, flowing speech. In English, this often involves blending words together and altering their sounds in order to make them easier to say. For example, the words "I'm going" are often said as "I'mma" in casual speech. Another example is the word "going" which can be pronounced as "gonna" in casual speech. These alterations are an important aspect of connected speech in English, and they help to make spoken language more fluid and natural-sounding.
