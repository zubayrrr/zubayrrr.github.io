Simply put, Mercury retrograde is an astrological phenomenon that occurs when the fast-moving planet Mercury—which takes 88 days to orbit the Sun, as opposed to Earth’s 365—seems to slow down. Planets move from East to West around the Sun. During Mercury retrograde, Mercury appears to move "backwards," from West to East.   
   
Mercury is _not_ actually reversing its orbit or moving backwards. Planets _always_ orbit the Sun in the same direction. The dreaded Mercury retrograde is merely an optical illusion caused by Mercury briefly overtaking Earth in its orbit around the Sun.   
   
About three or four times a year, Mercury goes "retrograde," which means it appears to go backwards in its orbit. In astrology, Mercury rules intellect and communication. Therefore, those who believe in astrology brace themselves for communication mishaps galore. During this four-week span, people might feel like they can't find the right words.
