- Internet Mail Application, operates on Port 143   
- Provides e-mail clients to retrieve e-mail messages from a mail server over a [tcp‚ÅÑip model](../devlog/tcp%E2%81%84ip%20model.md) connection.   
- Allows the end user to view and manipulate the messages as if they're stored locally.   
- Much better for modern communication in comparison to [POP3](../devlog/pop3.md) because it keeps inboxes on [Client](../devlog/client.md)/[Server](../devlog/server.md) synchronized.
