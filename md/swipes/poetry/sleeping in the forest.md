> I thought the earth     
> remembered me, she     
> took me back so tenderly, arranging   
> her dark skirts, her pockets     
> full of lichens and seeds. I slept     
> as never before, a stone     
> on the riverbed, nothing     
> between me and the white fire of the stars     
> but my thoughts, and they floated     
> light as moths among the branches     
> of the perfect trees. All night     
> I heard the small kingdoms breathing     
> around me, the insects, and the birds     
> who do their work in the darkness. All night     
> I rose and fell, as if in water, grappling     
> with a luminous doom. By morning     
> I had vanished at least a dozen times     
> into something better.
