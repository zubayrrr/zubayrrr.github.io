CloudWatch Events has been renamed to [AWS EventBridge](../devlog/AWS%20EventBridge.md) Events but it is the same API with some added functionality.   
   
[aws.sns](/not_created.md) and Amazon CloudWatch are integrated so users can collect, view, and analyze metrics for every active SNS. Once users have configured CloudWatch for Amazon SNS, they can gain better insight into the performance of their Amazon SNS topics, push notifications, and SMS deliveries.
