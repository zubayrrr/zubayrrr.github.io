## AWS Regions   
   
AWS Regions are separate geographic areas that AWS uses to house its infrastructure. These are distributed around the world so that customers can choose a region closest to them in order to host their cloud infrastructure there. The closer your region is to you, the better, so that you can reduce network latency as much as possible for your end-users. You want to be near the data centers for fast service.   
   
**Advantages**   
   
   
- High availability   
- Low latency   
- Global Footprint   
- Adherence to government regulations   
   
## AWS Availability Zones   
   
An AWS Availability Zone (AZ) is the logical building block that makes up an AWS Region. There are currently 69 AZs, which are isolated locations— data centers — within a region. Each region has multiple AZs and when you design your infrastructure to have backups of data in other AZs you are building a very efficient model of resiliency, i.e. a core concept of cloud computing.   
   
**AZs are within a Region** they're basically one or more discrete data center in a region. Each AZ has independent and redundant power, networking and connectivity. They increase availability and fault tolerance of applications in the same region.
