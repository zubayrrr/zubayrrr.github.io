> It has been noticed by many that autistic men are often exceptionally good at logical reasoning. Autists usually don’t have exceptionally high IQs; what they do have is exceptionally high realism.   
   
> To be ‘high cunning’ is to have the ability to charm people (make them like and trust you), persuade people, lie convincingly, read body language and vocal tonality accurately, and analyze social situations accurately.   
   
> If a person is immensely important to your life (say a potential spouse), then you will need to dig far deeper into their psychological makeup than simply ranking them on each of The Big 5 Traits.    
>    
> However, if a person is of only moderate importance to your life (say a subordinate employee), then estimating how they rank on each of The Big 5 Traits is enough; no need to dig any deeper into their psychological makeup than that.   
   
> Whether a person is extroverted or introverted and to what degree, is not determined by their ‘attitude’ or any conscious choice so much as it is by their neurochemistry; extroversion seems to be driven by dopaminergic function.   
   
> Many stimulants that enhance dopaminergic function within the brain also increase extroversion, at least temporarily. Caffeine is a notable example   
   
> The reason extroverts enjoy social interactions more than introverts is not because they desire intimate relationships or love (that’s driven by agreeableness); it’s because they enjoy the _stimulation_ that comes from social interaction. In the same spirit, extroverts find bright lights and loud music to be enjoyable, while introverts find them to be annoying or even painful.   
   
> To be clear most disagreeable people don’t enjoy conflict; they simple tolerate it while experiencing far less pain from it than an agreeable person would.   
   
> Many mistakenly attribute anger to low agreeableness, when the real culprit is high neuroticism. Many mistakenly attribute being nervous about social interactions to low extroversion (being introverted), when the real culprit is high neuroticism. Anger, and anxiety surrounding social interactions, are both driven by high neuroticism; not a lack of agreeableness, or a lack of extroversion.   
   
**Agreeableness and Neuroticism, Comfort With Conflict**   
   
> The lower a person ranks on agreeableness and the lower they rank on neuroticism, the more psychologically comfortable they will be with conflict. ‘Conflict’ can range from a heated argument on the gentle side, to mortal combat on the intense side.   
   
> Conscientiousness is The Big 5’s way of measuring how hardworking or lazy a person is. Conscientious people work hard and keep their belongings organized. Unconscientious people are lazy and disorganized. Conscientiousness can be further divided into the sub-traits ‘Orderliness’ and ‘Industriousness’.   
   
> Industriousness determines how hardworking a person is. Orderliness drives disgust sensitivity; how much a person desires for the environment to be clean and organized.   
   
> Many unproductive people are disparagingly called ‘lazy’, when in truth their problem isn’t their personality (low industriousness), but rather it’s biological (low energy). Some people have less energy than others, and the old have less energy than the young. **If you lack energy, there are drugs that will help you (caffeine). If you lack industriousness, no drug can save you.**   
   
> People who are high IQ and high openness are intelligent and creative, while those who are high IQ and low openness are intelligent but _not_ creative (such people make great accountants).   
   
> Taken together with conscientiousness, you will find that Leftwingers tend to be high openness and low orderliness, while Rightwingers tend to be low openness and high orderliness.

## Facets of Cunning   
   
   
- Analytical Mind   
- Charm     
- Persuasion     
- Mask Wearing, PowerTalk     
- Intimidation/Bullying   
- Gender Disparities   
   
> You must be able to read body language and vocal tonality accurately and be able to understand the covert subtext behind any overtly spoken words. As Illimitable Man said, “Communication is multi-layered; you should always understand what is being said, what is truly meant and what may possibly be implied.”   
   
> [Cold reading](../../archive/Cold%20reading.md) is the ability to make accurate deductions regarding an individual’s psychological makeup from nothing more than looking at them. Warm reading is cold reading but with time being spent interacting with the person, listening to how they talk, and observing their actions.   
   
> The ‘Analytical Mind’ facet of cunning must be distinguished from having a high IQ. To have a high IQ is to be capable of comprehending complexity, whether expressed verbally or mathematically. The ‘Analytical Mind’ facet of cunning is the ability to read body language, vocal tonality, personalities, and social situations accurately.   
   
> Charm is the ability to make people view you positively; to make them like and trust you. When people like you, it makes them more inclined to help you and more hesitant to harm you. Conversely when people dislike you it makes them less inclined to help you and more willing to harm you.   
   
> There is no surefire strategy for charming people, since what charms one person may offend another. Indeed, being reasonably good at cold reading is a basic requirement for being good at charm; you must be able to cold read people’s personalities, and present yourself in a way that will charm their specific personality.When attempting to charm, always take the sensibilities and biases of the specific target (person) at hand into account.   
   
> Persuasion, the ability to make people perceive that you are credible, what you are saying is true, and the ability to change people’s opinions, is often a make or break factor.   
   
> As such, in most situations you’re best bet is to simply smile and nod; maintain the pretense that you agree with their opinion, even if you don’t. It is unwise to make enemies unnecessarily.   
   
> Directly expressing disagreement causes the other person to view you as an adversary who should not be trusted, and whose words should be rejected. By appearing to agree with their current opinion (at least as a starting point), you cause the target to view you as an ally, someone who should be listened to.   
   
> A moderate step in the right direction is often sufficient for the purposes at hand; getting them to the perfect destination is usually unnecessary.   
   
> There are those who will say you should ‘just be yourself’. This is terrible advice. Far better advice is this: _wear the mask that the day and the moment require._   
   
for the sake of charming people, mask wearing will be necessary.   
   
> ‘StraightTalk’ is saying what you actually think. ‘PowerTalk’ is _not_ saying what you actually think, but rather saying what will be most tactically effective for the situation you are in.   
   
> Those who use PowerTalk filter their speech, self censor, and outright say things they don’t believe are true, all for the sake of tactical expediency. Needless to say, for the sake of succeeding in the game of power your default mode of speech should be PowerTalk.   
   
> The minimum applications of PowerTalk you will need to be able to execute effectively are as follows: maintain the pretense that you like every person you encounter (Law 43), and pay lip service to whatever is politically correct in the time and place where you live (Law 38).   
   
> Think As You Like, But Behave Like Others   
   
> Autistic men seem to be almost entirely incapable of PowerTalk; autists are hopelessly driven to say what they actually think (StraightTalk) the consequences be damned.   
   
> When using PowerTalk there is a paradox. You must monitor every word that comes out of your mouth; everything you say must be carefully calculated. At the same time, if it appears that you are calculating what you’re saying, people perceive you as awkward at best and dishonest at worst.   
   
> Your words must be inwardly calculated, while on the outside seem to flow naturally, with an ease that makes people perceive you are saying what you actually think.   
   
> This sounds like an impossible task. It will be if you speak a million sentences a day. However, if you speak only 100 sentences a day it’s very doable. Limit how much you talk, and regulating everything you say becomes a practical endeavor.   
   
> It is in your best interest to have as many allies as possible and as few enemies as possible, and as such you should use charm as often as possible and intimidation as rarely as possible, if ever.   
   
> You must appear to be low on both **agreeableness** _and_ low on **neuroticism**; this causes people to perceive you as a cold blooded killer; someone who inspires fear.   
   
> Intimidation is the exception where men tend to do better with executing intimidation than women because men rank lower on both agreeableness and neuroticism; low agreeableness and neuroticism makes men more psychologically comfortable with direct, overt, and intense conflict.

## Venues for Machiavellianism   
   
   
- Cold Reading and Charm, Key Facets of Cunning   
- School   
- Family Politics   
- Job Interviews   
- Office Politics   
- Sales/Marketing   
- Negotiation (Zero Sum)   
   
**Cold Reading and Charm** If you can accurately read people’s psychologies and make them like you, you will win. If you can’t read people’s psychologies and people find you to be dislikeable, you will lose.   
   
Job interviews don’t select candidates who are competent; they select candidates who are likeable.   
   
You are in zero sum competition with coworkers who have the same rank as you for seizing the same promotion opportunities; While being in intense zero sum conflict with them, you must always maintain the pretense that you are all on the same team.   
   
You must always maintain the pretense that you are a loyal employee, and that you enjoy being a corporate employee. **Hide your displeasure, fake your contentment.**   
   
The main strategy for succeeding within office politics will be this: triangulate who your critical superiors are, those people who wield decision-making power over whether you are promoted or fired.   
   
Whether or not it is actually in the target’s best interest to buy product is supremely irrelevant; you must persuade them to buy product, the consequences be damned.   
   
   
> Do not take payment in politeness — Baltasar Gracian
   
   
At no point in negotiation should you ever insult the other party; if they feel offended in any way, they may refuse to do business with you even if it would objectively be in their best interest to.

## Principles of Machiavellianism   
    
   
- Morally Neutral   
- Conceal Your Cunning   
- Variance of Skill   
- Levels of Difficulty   
- Everyone At The Top Is Cunning   
- Psychology vs Machiavellianism   
- Mastery   
- Prioritization   
   
Many conflate cunning with evil, but this is foolish. Cunning can be used for good or for evil, or for purposes that are inconsequential. Being unskilled with machiavellianism doesn’t make you good; it just makes you incompetent.   
   
The game is to be sold, not to be told. If you practice cunning you will succeed, if you talk about cunning you will fail.   
   
A ‘Machiavellian’ is someone who regularly makes conscious calculations regarding social interactions and relationships, and who executes manipulative tactics with careful planning beforehand, conscious effort in the moment, and thorough analysis afterwards of what went well and what went badly.   
   
The cunning of the average man is executed with only subconscious awareness, and the cunning of the average woman is executed with semi-conscious awareness.   
   
Know this; when you read people’s body language and personalities with razor sharp accuracy, most people cannot do the same. If you encounter someone who _can_ do the same, they are an outlier.   
   
Different venues and situations pose different levels of difficulty in terms of how skilled a machiavellian must be to attain victory.   
   
If ever you meet a powerful person who appears to have an average level of cunning, or who appears to be brazenly naïve, they are wearing a mask.   
   
The higher you go up a macro dominance hierarchy (euphemistically called ‘society’) the more cunning and competent the people you deal with will be.   
   
The relationship between psychology and machiavellianism is analogous to the relationship between mathematics and engineering. Psychology is theoretical and evergreen; human psychology hasn’t changed in thousands of years, and it won’t change in your lifetime. Machiavellianism is the application of psychology to the real world; strategies and tactics being used to execute the real world manipulation of other human beings.   
   
As a general guideline, keep the strategies and tactics you use as simple as possible. As the complexity of your strategies and tactics increases linearly, the probability of something going wrong increases exponentially.   
   
Mastery will require far more than simply reading; practice and experience in the real world are required. 10% of your time should be spent reading books on psychology and strategy, and 90% of your time should be spent interacting with people in the real world.   
   
From books on psychology and machiavellianism, you will find 10,000 different strategies and tactics. They will have a [pareto distribution](../../archive/pareto%20distribution.md) of usefulness; 9,900 of them will have no application to your life. 90 will have some application to your life. 10 will be directly relevant to your life, and you will use them every day until you die.
