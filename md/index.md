# The Unthought Known   
   
This is [my](./archive/about.md) personal wiki, a commonplace book, a [digital garden](./archive/Digital%20Garden.md), a [Second Brain](./archive/Second%20Brain.md); notes by me, for me.   
   
ðŸš§ Permanently under construction ðŸš§   
   
<!-- ![](https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1667399873/wiki/bnhamrfzhgkmct7hpfd1.png) -->   
   
This wiki was made possible with:    
   
   
- [Obisidian.md](https://obsidian.md) for note taking/PKM workflow.   
- [obsidian-html](https://github.com/obsidian-html/obsidian-html) for publishing.   
- [Github](https://github.com/zubayrrr/zubayrrr.github.io) repository for storage/backup and Github Pages for hosting.   
   
## Principles   
   
### All notes should be relative to me.   
   
   
- All notes in principle are written for me; what I know about a subject, how I feel about a particular thing.   
- Opinions are fine as long as I feel strong epistemic confidence in the given opinion.   
- Don't over explain a note if it's not necessary, remember, these notes are for you and are relative to whatever knowledge you posses about the subject.   
- Read books and make an dedicated note for them.   
- Listen podcasts but capture them inside a "subject specific" note or "Map of Concept" note or a note tagged `{_obsidian_pattern_tag_topics}` Because making notes from podcasts can be tedious as they're not as well structured as books for consumption.(Whose merit is debatable.)   
- `{_obsidian_pattern_tag_topics}` are basically "Map of Concept" notes but I have recently come to the realization that its better to maintain them [Nikita Voloboev style](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/) but with heavy usage of transclusion and backlinking.   
  - "[Resources](./resources/resources.md)" should be first processed and then mentioned inside the note, otherwise they should be left in inbox.   
   
### Gotta capture 'em all   
   
   
- Hog whatever information tickles your pickle([anything that gratifies one's intellectual curiosity](https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html)).   
- `{_obsidian_pattern_tag_swipes}` are interesting/useful bits of... `{_obsidian_pattern_tag_quotes,}` `{_obsidian_pattern_tag_excerpts}` , `{_obsidian_pattern_tag_sayings}` , `{_obsidian_pattern_tag_phrases}` . Essentially, ideas, opinions that are swiped off from `{_obsidian_pattern_tag_people}`   
- Make no distinction between "your" ideas and ideas of "others", because if you vibe with an idea; it's already yours.   
- But also remember "If you've time to consume, you've time to produce.".   
- Use [raindrop.io](https://raindrop.io) to manage your URL bookmarks.   
- If you need to bookmark a webpage or an article all together, use [MarkDownload](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/markdownload-markdown-web/pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi?hl=en-GB) to rip the entire page. Let's call it a `{_obsidian_pattern_tag_webmark;}` it belong in the `/inbox`.   
- Similar process is employed for capturing tweets using [tweet-to-markdown](https://github.com/kbravh/tweet-to-markdown) and it also belongs in the `/inbox`.   
   
### Don't force evolution   
   
   
- Let your second brain evolve at it's own pace.   
- The structure should never be _too_ rigid because its meant to take form by itself.   
   
### Noise & Signal   
   
   
- While capturing ideas left and right is recommended, make sure you're not harming your periods of focus.   
- Have impenetrable focus periods (use Pomodoro method) where you only care about the work on hand and nothing else.   
   
### Why do any of this?   
   
   
- Because I can't remember everything - there's a lot of information around that interests me and there isn't enough working memory installed in me.   
- So, I make notes - to remember, to create, to meditate, to think.   
- A bodybuilder's portfolio is their body - my portfolio is my wiki.   
- Not only am I making - whatever I know - tangible by writing it down. I know exactly where to look if I ever forget something.   
- I am at the beginning of my learning adventures. When I look back at it, I will know where I came from and how my thoughts evolved over time.   
- Plus, its really fun to nerd out.

## Structure of this wiki   
   
   
- [Ontology](./archive/ontology.md) explains the structure of this wiki and the tags, backlinks used in it.   
- Dendron takes care of the structure and hierarchy(mostly), but I insist on using tags for backwards compatibility.
