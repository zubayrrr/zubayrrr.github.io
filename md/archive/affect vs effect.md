[Affect](#Affect) is usually a verb meaning "to produce an effect upon," as in "the weather affected his mood." [Effect](#Effect) is usually a noun meaning "a change that results when something is done or happens," as in "computers have had a huge effect on our lives." There are exceptions, but if you think of affect as a verb and effect as a noun, you’ll be right a majority of the time.
