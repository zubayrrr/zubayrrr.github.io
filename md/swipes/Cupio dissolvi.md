Cupio dissolvi is a Latin phrase that means "I desire to be dissolved." It is often used in a spiritual or philosophical context to express a desire for transcendence or liberation from the limitations of the physical world.   
   
The phrase Cupio dissolvi comes from the writings of St. Paul the Apostle, who used it to describe his desire to be united with Christ in death, so that he could experience the fullness of life in the resurrection. In this context, the phrase can be understood as expressing a desire to let go of earthly attachments and limitations in order to experience a deeper sense of unity and oneness with the divine.   
   
Cupio dissolvi has also been interpreted more broadly as a metaphor for the desire to let go of ego and self-centeredness in order to experience a deeper sense of connection with others and the world around us. In this sense, the phrase can be understood as expressing a desire for spiritual transformation and enlightenment.   
   
It is often associated with the phrase "Mortem aut Cupio dissolvi aut victoria" which translates to "Either death or I wish to be dissolved or victory." This phrase is believed to have been used by the Roman general Scipio Africanus as a rallying cry for his soldiers before a battle.
