Creatine is a naturally occurring amino acid that is found in the body and is also available in supplement form. It is commonly used to improve athletic performance and increase muscle mass. While creatine supplements are generally considered safe when taken in recommended doses, there are a few potential side effects that you should be aware of.   
   
Some common side effects of creatine supplements include:   
   
1.  Weight gain: Creatine can cause an increase in muscle mass, which can lead to weight gain.   
       
2.  Digestive issues: Some people may experience digestive issues such as stomach pain, nausea, and diarrhea when taking creatine supplements.   
       
3.  Dehydration: Creatine can increase water retention in the muscles, which can lead to dehydration if you don't drink enough water.   
       
4.  Muscle cramps: Some people may experience muscle cramps while taking creatine supplements.   
       
5.  Kidney damage: There is some concern that high doses of creatine may cause kidney damage, although research on this topic is mixed.   
       
   
It is important to note that these side effects are generally rare and tend to occur only in people who are taking high doses of creatine or who have certain medical conditions. If you are considering taking creatine supplements, it is important to speak with your healthcare provider to determine if they are safe for you. They can help you weigh the potential benefits and risks and determine the appropriate dosage for you.

[Micronized Creatine is essentially creatine monohydrate, except it has been micronized, which means the molecules of creatine have been divided or cut up. This increases their surface area 20 times, increasing absorption and reducing stomach discomfort.](https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/is-there-a-difference-between-the-various-forms-of-creatine.html)
