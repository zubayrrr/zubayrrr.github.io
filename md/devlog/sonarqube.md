SonarQube® is an automatic code review tool to detect bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells in your code. It can integrate with your existing workflow to enable continuous code inspection across your project branches and pull requests.   
   
   
- [SonarLint](https://www.sonarlint.org/) – SonarLint is a companion product that works in your editor giving immediate feedback so you can catch and fix issues before they get to the repository.   
- [Quality Gate](https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/user-guide/quality-gates/) – The Quality Gate lets you know if your project is ready for production.   
- [Clean as You Code](https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/user-guide/clean-as-you-code/) – Clean as You Code is an approach to code quality that eliminates a lot of the challenges that come with traditional approaches. As a developer, you focus on maintaining high standards and taking responsibility specifically in the New Code you're working on.   
- [Issues](https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/user-guide/issues/) – SonarQube raises issues whenever a piece of your code breaks a coding rule, whether it's an error that will break your code (bug), a point in your code open to attack (vulnerability), or a maintainability issue (code smell).   
- [Security Hotspots](https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/user-guide/security-hotspots/) – SonarQube highlights security-sensitive pieces of code that need to be reviewed. Upon review, you'll either find there is no threat or you need to apply a fix to secure the code.
