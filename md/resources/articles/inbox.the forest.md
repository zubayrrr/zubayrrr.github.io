Surfing the web is becoming increasingly boring.   
   
What used to be a wild trip through stormy waters has now become a journey on a cruise ship where everything is planned and there's no longer place for craziness.   
   
This site is our attempt try bring some of that unpredictability back.   
   
The next rabbit hole can be just one click away so click that button, go for a walk and enjoy getting lost on the web.
