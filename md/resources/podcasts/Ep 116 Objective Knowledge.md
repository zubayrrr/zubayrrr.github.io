## Ep 116: Objective Knowledge   
   
00:00:56 When something is described as Objective it means there is a truth of the matter independent of what someone thinks or feels or perceives or believes.   
   
00:02:20 The two senses of objectivity vs subjectivity; fact of the matter.   
Epistemological difference between objectivity and subjectivity.   
   
00:03:07 There can be an objective truth to my subjectivity. kinda oxymoronic? but theyâ€™re limited to my mind and these objective-subjective truths that I claim are not about objects out there.
